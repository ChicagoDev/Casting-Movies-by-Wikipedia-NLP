cuban missile crisis, also known as the october crisis of (spanish crisis de octubre), the caribbean crisis (russian карибский кризис, tr. karibsky krizis, ipa kɐˈrʲipskʲɪj ˈkrʲizʲɪs ), or the missile scare, was a day (october – , ) confrontation between the united states and the soviet union initiated by american ballistic missile deployment in italy and turkey with consequent soviet ballistic missile deployment in cuba. the confrontation is often considered the closest the cold war came to escalating into a full scale nuclear war. in response to the failed bay of pigs invasion of and the presence of american jupiter ballistic missiles in italy and turkey, soviet leader nikita khrushchev agreed to cuba s request to place nuclear missiles on the island to deter a future invasion. an agreement was reached during a secret meeting between khrushchev and fidel castro in july , and construction of a number of missile launch facilities started later that summer. the united states elections were under way, and the white house had for months denied charges that it was ignoring dangerous soviet missiles miles ( km) from florida. the missile preparations were confirmed when an air force u spy plane produced clear photographic evidence of medium range (ss ) and intermediate range (r ) ballistic missile facilities. the us established a naval blockade on october to prevent further missiles from reaching cuba; oval office tapes during the crisis revealed that kennedy had also put the blockade in place as an attempt to provoke soviet backed forces in berlin as well. the us announced it would not permit offensive weapons to be delivered to cuba and demanded that the weapons already in cuba be dismantled and returned to the soviet union. after several days of tense negotiations, an agreement was reached between us president john f. kennedy and khrushchev. publicly, the soviets would dismantle their offensive weapons in cuba and return them to the soviet union, subject to united nations verification, in exchange for a us public declaration and agreement to avoid invading cuba again. secretly, the united states agreed that it would dismantle all us built jupiter mrbms, which had been deployed in turkey against the soviet union; there has been debate on whether or not italy was included in the agreement as well. when all offensive missiles and ilyushin il light bombers had been withdrawn from cuba, the blockade was formally ended on november , . the negotiations between the united states and the soviet union pointed out the necessity of a quick, clear, and direct communication line between washington and moscow. as a result, the moscow–washington hotline was established. a series of agreements reduced us–soviet tensions for several years until both parties began to build their nuclear arsenal even further. contents earlier us actions balance of power soviet deployment of missiles in cuba missiles reported . aerial images find soviet

plans external links earlier us actions edit with the end of world war ii and the start of the cold war, the united states had grown concerned about the expansion of communism. a latin american country openly allying with the soviet union was regarded by the us as unacceptable. it would, for example, defy the monroe doctrine, a us policy limiting us involvement in european colonies and european affairs but holding that the western hemisphere was in the us sphere of influence. the kennedy administration had been publicly embarrassed by the failed bay of pigs invasion in may , which had been launched under president john f. kennedy by cia trained forces of cuban exiles. afterward, former president dwight eisenhower told kennedy that the failure of the bay of pigs will embolden the soviets to do something that they would otherwise not do. the half hearted invasion left soviet premier nikita khrushchev and his advisers with the impression that kennedy was indecisive and, as one soviet adviser wrote, too young, intellectual, not prepared well for decision making in crisis situations... too intelligent and too weak. us covert operations against cuba continued in with the unsuccessful operation mongoose. in addition, khrushchev s impression of kennedy s weaknesses was confirmed by the president s response during the berlin crisis of , particularly to the building of the berlin wall. speaking to soviet officials in the aftermath of the crisis, khrushchev asserted, i know for certain that kennedy doesn t have a strong background, nor, generally speaking, does he have the courage to stand up to a serious challenge. he also told his son sergei that on cuba, kennedy would make a fuss, make more of a fuss, and then agree. in january , us army general edward lansdale described plans to overthrow the cuban government in a top secret report (partially declassified ), addressed to kennedy and officials involved with operation mongoose. cia agents or pathfinders from the special activities division were to be infiltrated into cuba to carry out sabotage and organization, including radio broadcasts. in february , the us launched an embargo against cuba, and lansdale presented a page, top secret timetable for implementation of the overthrow of the cuban government, mandating guerrilla operations to begin in august and september. open revolt and overthrow of the communist regime would occur in the first two weeks of october. balance of power edit this section needs additional citations for verification. please help improve this article by

remove this template message) when kennedy ran for president in , one of his key election issues was an alleged missile gap with the soviets leading. actually, the us at that time led the soviets by a wide margin that would only increase. in , the soviets had only four intercontinental ballistic missiles (r semyorka). by october , they may have had a few dozen, with some intelligence estimates as high as . the us, on the other hand, had icbms and was quickly building more. it also had eight george washington and ethan allen class ballistic missile submarines, with the capability to launch polaris missiles, each with a range of , nautical miles ( , km). khrushchev increased the perception of a missile gap when he loudly boasted to the world that the soviets were building missiles like sausages but soviet missiles numbers and capabilities were nowhere close to his assertions. the soviet union had medium range ballistic missiles in quantity, about of them, but they were very unreliable and inaccurate. the us had a considerable advantage in total number of nuclear warheads ( , against , ) and in the technology required for their accurate delivery. the us also led in missile defensive capabilities, naval and air power; but the soviets had a – advantage in conventional ground forces, more pronounced in field guns and tanks, particularly in the european theater. in , in the putin interviews with the director oliver stone, the russian president vladimir putin said that the placement of russian missiles in cuba was a russian reaction to the earlier stationing of american missiles in turkey in (pgm jupiter). it was khruschev s attempt to achieve a balance of power. soviet deployment of missiles in cuba edit this section is too long. consider splitting it into new pages, adding subheadings, or condensing it. (february ) in may , soviet premier nikita khrushchev was persuaded by the idea of countering the us s growing lead in developing and deploying strategic missiles by placing soviet intermediate range nuclear missiles in cuba, despite the misgivings of the soviet ambassador in havana, alexandr ivanovich alexeyev, who argued that castro would not accept the deployment of the missiles. khrushchev faced a strategic situation in which the us was perceived to have a splendid first strike capability that put the soviet union at a huge disadvantage. in , the soviets had only icbms capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the us from inside the soviet union. the poor accuracy and reliability of the missiles raised serious doubts about their effectiveness. a newer, more reliable generation of icbms would become operational only after . therefore, soviet nuclear capability in placed less emphasis on icbms than on medium and intermediate range ballistic missiles (mrbms and irbms). the missiles could hit american allies and most of alaska from soviet territory but not the contiguous united states. graham allison, the director of harvard university s belfer center for science and international affairs, points out, the soviet union could not right the nuclear imbalance by deploying new icbms on its own soil. in order to meet the threat it faced in , , and , it had very few options. moving existing nuclear weapons to locations from which they could reach american targets was one. a second reason that soviet missiles were deployed to cuba was because khrushchev wanted to bring west berlin, controlled by the american, british and french within communist east germany, into the soviet orbit. the east germans and soviets considered western control over a portion of berlin a grave threat to east germany. khrushchev made west berlin the central battlefield of the cold war. khrushchev believed that if the us did nothing over the missile deployments in cuba, he could muscle the west out of berlin using said missiles as a deterrent to western countermeasures in berlin. if the us tried to bargain with the soviets after it became aware of the missiles, khrushchev could demand trading the missiles for west berlin. since berlin was strategically more important than cuba, the trade would be a win for khrushchev, as kennedy recognized the advantage is, from khrushchev s point of view, he takes a great chance but there are quite some rewards to it. thirdly, from the perspective of the soviet union and of cuba, it seemed that the united states wanted to increase its presence in cuba. with actions like attempting to expel cuba from the organization of american states, placing economic sanctions on the nation and conducting secret operations on containing communism and cuba, it was assumed that america was trying to invade cuba. as a result, to try and prevent this, the ussr would place missiles in cuba and neutralize the threat. more than us built missiles having the capability to strike moscow with nuclear warheads were deployed in italy and turkey in . khrushchev was also reacting in part to the nuclear threat of obsolescent jupiter intermediate range ballistic missiles that had been installed by the us in turkey in april . additionally, placing nuclear missiles on cuba was a way for khrushchev to display and assert his strict political dominance; this was a much needed display after numerous individuals within the soviet union began to doubt khrushchev s power as they believed that he was appeasing the americans. another major reason why khrushchev placed missiles on cuba was to level the playing field. before this event, america had the upper hand as they could launch from turkey and destroy the ussr before they would have a chance to react. after the transmission of nuclear missiles, khrushchev had finally established mutually assured destruction meaning that if america decided to launch a nuclear strike against the ussr, the latter would react by launching a retaliatory nuclear strike against america. additionally, placing nuclear missiles on cuba was a way for the ussr to show their support for cuba and support the cuban people whose rights were taken away by the united states, as the latter had become their ally after the cuban revolution of . according to khrushchev, the soviet union s motives were aimed at allowing cuba to live peacefully and develop as its people desire . an indirect reason why khrushchev placed missiles on cuba would be to try to establish the extent to which the soviet union could threaten the united states. prior to this, there was no clear demarcation of how the united states was willing to react, and with new president john f. kennedy, it was unknown to the soviet union how far they could manipulate the united states. by placing missiles in cuba, on the u.s. s doorstep, the extent to which the united states would react would be clear. in early , a group of soviet military and missile construction specialists accompanied an agricultural delegation to havana. they obtained a meeting with cuban leader fidel castro. the cuban leadership had a strong expectation that the us would invade cuba again and enthusiastically approved the idea of installing nuclear missiles in cuba. according to another source, castro objected to the missiles deployment that would have made him look like a soviet puppet, but he was persuaded that missiles in cuba would be an irritant to the us and help the interests of the entire socialist camp. also, the deployment would include short range tactical weapons (with a range of km, usable only against naval vessels) that would provide a nuclear umbrella for attacks upon the island. by may, khrushchev and castro agreed to place strategic nuclear missiles secretly in cuba. like castro, khrushchev felt that a us invasion of cuba was imminent and that to lose cuba would do great harm to the communists, especially in latin america. he said he wanted to confront the americans with more than words.... the logical answer was missiles. the soviets maintained their tight secrecy, writing their plans longhand, which were approved by marshal of the soviet union rodion malinovsky on july and khrushchev on july . from the very beginning, the soviets operation entailed elaborate denial and deception, known as maskirovka . all the planning and preparation for transporting and deploying the missiles were carried out in the utmost secrecy, with only a very few told the exact nature of the mission. even the troops detailed for the mission were given misdirection by being told that they were headed for a cold region and being outfitted with ski boots, fleece lined parkas, and other winter equipment. the soviet codename was operation anadyr. the anadyr river flows into the bering sea, and anadyr is also the capital of chukotsky district and a bomber base in the far eastern region. all the measures were meant to conceal the program from both internal and external audiences. specialists in missile construction under the guise of machine operators, irrigation specialists, and agricultural specialists arrived in july. a total of , foreign troops would ultimately be brought in. chief marshal of artillery sergei biryuzov, head of the soviet rocket forces, led a survey team that visited cuba. he told khrushchev that the missiles would be concealed and camouflaged by palm trees. the cuban leadership was further upset when in september, the us congress approved joint resolution , which expressed congress s resolve to prevent the creation of an externally supported military establishment. on the same day, the us announced a major military exercise in the caribbean, phibriglex , which cuba denounced as a deliberate provocation and proof that the us planned to invade cuba. unreliable source? the soviet leadership believed, based on its perception of kennedy s lack of confidence during the bay of pigs invasion, that he would avoid confrontation and accept the missiles as a fait accompli. on september , the soviet union publicly warned that a us attack on cuba or on soviet ships that were carrying supplies to the island would mean war. the soviets continued the maskirovka program to conceal their actions in cuba. they repeatedly denied that the weapons being brought into cuba were offensive in nature. on september , soviet ambassador to the united states anatoly dobrynin assured united states ambassador to the united nations adlai stevenson that the soviet union was supplying only defensive weapons to cuba. on september , the telegrafnoe agentstvo sovetskogo soyuza (soviet news agency tass) announced that the soviet union had no need or intention to introduce offensive nuclear missiles into cuba. on october , dobrynin was questioned by former undersecretary of state chester bowles about whether the soviets planned to put offensive weapons in cuba. he denied any such plans. on october , soviet embassy official georgy bolshakov brought president kennedy a personal message from khrushchev reassuring him that under no circumstances would surface to surface missiles be sent to cuba. as early as august , the us suspected the soviets of building missile facilities in cuba. during that month, its intelligence services gathered information about sightings by ground observers of russian built mig fighters and il light bombers. u spyplanes found s dvina (nato designation sa ) surface to air missile sites at eight different locations. cia director john a. mccone was suspicious. sending antiaircraft missiles into cuba, he reasoned, made sense only if moscow intended to use them to shield a base for ballistic missiles aimed at the united states. on august , he wrote a memo to kennedy in which he guessed that the soviets were preparing to introduce ballistic missiles into cuba. with important congressional elections scheduled for november, the crisis became enmeshed in american politics. on august , senator kenneth keating (r new york) warned on the senate floor that the soviet union was in all probability constructing a missile base in cuba. he charged the kennedy administration with covering up a major threat to the us, thereby starting the crisis. he may have received this initial remarkably accurate information from his friend, former congresswoman and ambassador clare booth luce, who in turn received it from cuban exiles. a later confirming source for keating s information possibly was the west german ambassdor to cuba, who had received information from dissidents inside cuba that soviet troops had arrived in cuba in early august and were seen working in all probability on or near a missile base and who passed this information to keating on a trip to washington in early october. air force general curtis lemay presented a pre invasion bombing plan to kennedy in september, and spy flights and minor military harassment from us forces at guantanamo bay naval base were the subject of continual cuban diplomatic complaints to the us government. map created by american intelligence showing surface to air missile activity in cuba, september , the first consignment of r missiles arrived on the night of september , followed by a second on september . the r was a medium range ballistic missile, capable of carrying a thermonuclear warhead. it was a single stage, road transportable, surface launched, storable liquid propellant fueled missile that could deliver a megaton class nuclear weapon. the soviets were building nine sites—six for r medium range missiles (nato designation ss sandal) with an effective range of , kilometres ( , mi) and three for r intermediate range ballistic missiles (nato designation ss skean) with a maximum range of , kilometres ( , mi). on october , cuban president osvaldo dorticós torrado spoke at the un general assembly if... we are attacked, we will defend ourselves. i repeat, we have sufficient means with which to defend ourselves; we have indeed our inevitable weapons, the weapons, which we would have preferred not to acquire, and which we do not wish to employ. citation needed on october in another senate speech sen. keating reaffirmed his earlier warning of august and stated that, construction has begun on at least a half dozen launching sites for intermediate range tactical missiles. missiles reported edit the missiles in cuba allowed the soviets to target effectively most of the continental us. the planned arsenal was forty launchers. the cuban populace readily noticed the arrival and deployment of the missiles and hundreds of reports reached miami. us intelligence received countless reports, many of dubious quality or even laughable, most of which could be dismissed as describing defensive missiles. citation needed only five reports bothered the analysts. they described large trucks passing through towns at night that were carrying very long canvas covered cylindrical objects that could not make turns through towns without backing up and maneuvering. defensive missiles could turn. the reports could not be satisfactorily dismissed. a u reconnaissance photograph of cuba, showing soviet nuclear missiles, their transports and tents for fueling and maintenance. aerial images find soviet missiles edit the united states had been sending u surveillance over cuba since the failed bay of pigs invasion. the first issue that led to a pause in reconnaissance flights took place on august , when a u operated by the us air force s strategic air command flew over sakhalin island in the soviet far east by mistake. the soviets lodged a protest and the us apologized. nine days later, a taiwanese operated u was lost over western china to an sa surface to air missile. us officials were worried that one of the cuban or soviet sams in cuba might shoot down a cia u , initiating another international incident. in a meeting with members of the committee on overhead reconnaissance (comor) on september , secretary of state dean rusk and national security advisor mcgeorge bundy heavily restricted further u flights over cuban airspace. the resulting lack of coverage over the island for the next five weeks became known to historians as the photo gap. no significant u coverage was achieved over the interior of the island. us officials attempted to use a corona photoreconnaissance satellite to obtain coverage over reported soviet military deployments, but imagery acquired over western cuba by a corona kh mission on october was heavily covered by clouds and haze and failed to provide any usable intelligence. at the end of september, navy reconnaissance aircraft photographed the soviet ship kasimov, with large crates on its deck the size and shape of il jet bomber fuselages. in september , analysts from the defense intelligence agency (dia) noticed that cuban surface to air missile sites were arranged in a pattern similar to those used by the soviet union to protect its icbm bases, leading dia to lobby for the resumption of u flights over the island. although in the past the flights had been conducted by the cia, pressure from the defense department made the authority be transferred to the air force. following the loss of a cia u over the soviet union in may , it was thought that if another u were shot down, an air force aircraft arguably being used for a legitimate military purpose would be easier to explain than a cia flight. when the reconnaissance missions were reauthorized on october , poor weather kept the planes from flying. the us first obtained u photographic evidence of the missiles on october , when a u flight piloted by major richard heyser took pictures on a path selected by dia analysts, capturing images of what turned out to be an ss construction site at san cristóbal, pinar del río province (now in artemisa province), in western cuba. one of the first u reconnaissance images of missile bases under construction shown to president kennedy on the morning of october , president notified edit on october , the cia s national photographic interpretation center (npic) reviewed the u photographs and identified objects that they interpreted as medium range ballistic missiles. this identification was made, in part, on the strength of reporting provided by oleg penkovsky, a double agent in the gru working for cia and mi . although he provided no direct reports of the soviet missile deployments to cuba, technical and doctrinal details of soviet missile regiments that had been provided by penkovsky in the months and years prior to the crisis helped npic analysts correctly identify the missiles on u imagery. that evening, the cia notified the department of state and at pm edt, bundy chose to wait until the next morning to tell the president. mcnamara was briefed at midnight. the next morning, bundy met with kennedy and showed him the u photographs and briefed him on the cia s analysis of the images. at pm edt, kennedy convened a meeting of the nine members of the national security council and five other key advisors, in a group he formally named the executive committee of the national security council (excomm) after the fact on october by the national security action memorandum . without informing the members of excomm, president kennedy tape recorded all of their proceedings, and sheldon m. stern, head of the kennedy library transcribed some of them. responses considered edit president kennedy meets in the oval office with general curtis lemay and the reconnaissance pilots who found the missile sites in cuba. the us had no plan in place because its intelligence had been convinced that the soviets would never install nuclear missiles in cuba. excomm, of which vice president lyndon b. johnson was a member, quickly discussed several possible courses of action do nothing american vulnerability to soviet missiles was not new. diplomacy use diplomatic pressure to get the soviet union to remove the missiles. secret approach offer castro the choice of splitting with the russians or being invaded. invasion full force invasion of cuba and overthrow of castro. air strike use the us air force to attack all known missile sites. blockade use the us navy to block any missiles from arriving in cuba. as the article describes, both the us and the soviet union considered many possible outcomes of their actions and threats during the crisis (allison, graham t.; zelikow, philip d.). this game tree models how both actors would have considered their decisions. it is broken down into a simple form for basic understanding. the joint chiefs of staff unanimously agreed that a full scale attack and invasion was the only solution. they believed that the soviets would not attempt to stop the us from conquering cuba. kennedy was skeptical .mw parser output .templatequote overflow hidden;margin em

they can t, after all their statements, permit us to take out their missiles, kill a lot of russians, and then do nothing. if they don t take action in cuba, they certainly will in berlin. kennedy concluded that attacking cuba by air would signal the soviets to presume a clear line to conquer berlin. kennedy also believed that us allies would think of the country as trigger happy cowboys who lost berlin because they could not peacefully resolve the cuban situation. president kennedy and secretary of defense mcnamara in an excomm meeting. the excomm then discussed the effect on the strategic balance of power, both political and military. the joint chiefs of staff believed that the missiles would seriously alter the military balance, but mcnamara disagreed. an extra , he reasoned, would make little difference to the overall strategic balance. the us already had approximately , strategic warheads, but the soviet union had only . mcnamara concluded that the soviets having would not therefore substantially alter the strategic balance. in , he reiterated that it made no difference.... the military balance wasn t changed. i didn t believe it then, and i don t believe it now. the excomm agreed that the missiles would affect the political balance. kennedy had explicitly promised the american people less than a month before the crisis that if cuba should possess a capacity to carry out offensive actions against the united states... the united states would act. – also, credibility among us allies and people would be damaged if the soviet union appeared to redress the strategic balance by placing missiles in cuba. kennedy explained after the crisis that it would have politically changed the balance of power. it would have appeared to, and appearances contribute to reality. president kennedy meets with soviet foreign minister andrei gromyko in the oval office (october , ) on october , kennedy met with soviet minister of foreign affairs, andrei gromyko, who claimed the weapons were for defensive purposes only. not wanting to expose what he already knew and to avoid panicking the american public, kennedy did not reveal that he was already aware of the missile buildup. by october , frequent u spy flights showed four operational sites. operational plans edit two operational plans (oplan) were considered. oplan envisioned a full invasion of cuba by army and marine units, supported by the navy following air force and naval airstrikes. army units in the us would have had trouble fielding mechanized and logistical assets, and the us navy could not supply enough amphibious shipping to transport even a modest armored contingent from the army. oplan , primarily an air force and navy carrier operation, was designed with enough flexibility to do anything from engaging individual missile sites to providing air support for oplan s ground forces. blockade edit a us navy p h neptune of vp flying over a soviet cargo ship with crated il s on deck during the cuban crisis. kennedy met with members of excomm and other top advisers throughout october , considering two remaining options an air strike primarily against the cuban missile bases or a naval blockade of cuba. a full scale invasion was not the administration s first option. mcnamara supported the naval blockade as a strong but limited military action that left the us in control. the term blockade was problematic. according to international law, a blockade is an act of war, but the kennedy administration did not think that the soviets would be provoked to attack by a mere blockade. additionally, legal experts at the state department and justice department concluded that a declaration of war could be avoided if another legal justification, based on the rio treaty for defense of the western hemisphere, was obtained from a resolution by a two thirds vote from the members or the organization of american states (oas). admiral anderson, chief of naval operations wrote a position paper that helped kennedy to differentiate between what they termed a quarantine of offensive weapons and a blockade of all materials, claiming that a classic blockade was not the original intention. since it would take place in international waters, kennedy obtained the approval of the oas for military action under the hemispheric defense provisions of the rio treaty latin american participation in the quarantine now involved two argentine destroyers which were to report to the us commander south atlantic comsolant at trinidad on november . an argentine submarine and a marine battalion with lift were available if required. in addition, two venezuelan destroyers (destroyers arv d nueva esparta and arv d zulia ) and one submarine (caribe) had reported to comsolant, ready for sea by november . the government of trinidad and tobago offered the use of chaguaramas naval base to warships of any oas nation for the duration of the quarantine. the dominican republic had made available one escort ship. colombia was reported ready to furnish units and had sent military officers to the us to discuss this assistance. the argentine air force informally offered three sa aircraft in addition to forces already committed to the quarantine operation. this initially was to involve a naval blockade against offensive weapons within the framework of the organization of american states and the rio treaty. such a blockade might be expanded to cover all types of goods and air transport. the action was to be backed up by surveillance of cuba. the cno s scenario was followed closely in later implementing the quarantine. on october , the excomm formed separate working groups to examine the air strike and blockade options, and by the afternoon most support in the excomm shifted to the blockade option. reservations about the plan continued to be voiced as late as the october , the paramount concern being that once the blockade was put into effect, the soviets would rush to complete some of the missiles. consequently, the us could find itself bombing operational missiles if blockade failed to force khrushchev to remove the missiles already on the island. speech to the nation edit president kennedy signs the proclamation for interdiction of the delivery of offensive weapons to cuba at the oval office on october , . at pm edt on october , president kennedy formally established the executive committee (excomm) with national security action memorandum (nsam) . at pm, he met with congressional leaders who contentiously opposed a blockade and demanded a stronger response. in moscow, ambassador foy d. kohler briefed khrushchev on the pending blockade and kennedy s speech to the nation. ambassadors around the world gave notice to non eastern bloc leaders. before the speech, us delegations met with canadian prime minister john diefenbaker, british prime minister harold macmillan, west german chancellor konrad adenauer, french president charles de gaulle and secretary general of the organization of american states, josé antonio mora to brief them on the us intelligence and their proposed response. all were supportive of the us position, except macmillan who advocated appeasement. shortly before his speech, kennedy called former president dwight eisenhower. kennedy s conversation with the former president also revealed that the two were conspiring during the cuban missile crisis. the two also anticipated that khruschev would respond to the western world in a matter that was similar to his response during the suez crisis and would possibly wind up trading off berlin. address on the buildup of arms in cuba kennedy addressing the nation on october , about the buildup of arms on cuba problems playing this file? see media help. wikisource has original text related to this article cuban missile crisis on october at pm edt, kennedy delivered a nationwide televised address on all of the major networks announcing the discovery of the missiles. he noted it shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from cuba against any nation in the western hemisphere as an attack by the soviet union on the united states, requiring a full retaliatory response upon the soviet union. kennedy described the administration s plan to halt this offensive buildup, a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to cuba is being initiated. all ships of any kind bound for cuba, from whatever nation or port, will, if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons, be turned back. this quarantine will be extended, if needed, to other types of cargo and carriers. we are not at this time, however, denying the necessities of life as the soviets attempted to do in their berlin blockade of . during the speech, a directive went out to all us forces worldwide, placing them on defcon . the heavy cruiser uss newport news was designated flagship for the blockade, with uss leary as newport news s destroyer escort. crisis deepens edit khrushchev s october , letter to kennedy stating that the blockade of cuba constitute s an act of aggression... on october , at am edt, a cable, drafted by george wildman ball to the us ambassador in turkey and nato, notified them that they were considering making an offer to withdraw what the us knew to be nearly obsolete missiles from italy and turkey, in exchange for the soviet withdrawal from cuba. turkish officials replied that they would deeply resent any trade involving the us missile presence in their country. two days later, on the morning of october , american journalist walter lippmann proposed the same thing in his syndicated column. castro reaffirmed cuba s right to self defense and said that all of its weapons were defensive and cuba would not allow an inspection. international response edit three days after kennedy s speech, the chinese people s daily announced that , , chinese men and women were standing by the cuban people. in west germany, newspapers supported the us response by contrasting it with the weak american actions in the region during the preceding months. they also expressed some fear that the soviets might retaliate in berlin. in france on october , the crisis made the front page of all the daily newspapers. the next day, an editorial in le monde expressed doubt about the authenticity of the cia s photographic evidence. two days later, after a visit by a high ranking cia agent, the newspaper accepted the validity of the photographs. also in france, in the october issue of le figaro, raymond aron wrote in support of the american response. on october , pope john xxiii sent a message to the soviet embassy in rome to be transmitted to the kremlin in which he voiced his concern for peace. in this message he stated, we beg all governments not to remain deaf to this cry of humanity. that they do all that is in their power to save peace. soviet broadcast edit the crisis was continuing unabated, and in the evening of october , the soviet news agency tass broadcast a telegram from khrushchev to kennedy in which khrushchev warned that the united states s outright piracy would lead to war. that was followed at pm by a telegram from khrushchev to kennedy, which was received at pm edt. khrushchev stated, if you weigh the present situation with a cool head without giving way to passion, you will understand that the soviet union cannot afford not to decline the despotic demands of the usa and that the soviet union views the blockade as an act of aggression and their ships will be instructed to ignore it. us alert level raised edit adlai stevenson shows aerial photos of cuban missiles to the united nations, october , . the us requested an emergency meeting of the united nations security council on october . us ambassador to the united nations adlai stevenson confronted soviet ambassador valerian zorin in an emergency meeting of the security council, challenging him to admit the existence of the missiles. ambassador zorin refused to answer. the next day at pm edt, the us raised the readiness level of sac forces to defcon . for the only confirmed time in us history, b bombers went on continuous airborne alert, and b medium bombers were dispersed to various military and civilian airfields and made ready to take off, fully equipped, on minutes notice. one eighth of sac s , bombers were on airborne alert, and some intercontinental ballistic missiles stood on ready alert, some of which targeted cuba, and air defense command (adc) redeployed nuclear armed interceptors to dispersal fields within nine hours, with one third maintaining minute alert status. twenty three nuclear armed b s were sent to orbit points within striking distance of the soviet union so that it would believe that the us was serious. jack j. catton later estimated that about percent of sac s planes were ready for launch during the crisis; david a. burchinal recalled that, by contrast the russians were so thoroughly stood down, and we knew it. they didn t make any move. they did not increase their alert; they did not increase any flights, or their air defense posture. they didn t do a thing, they froze in place. we were never further from nuclear war than at the time of cuba, never further. by october , tactical air command (tac) had fighters plus supporting tankers and reconnaissance aircraft deployed to face cuba on one hour alert status. tac and the military air transport service had problems. the concentration of aircraft in florida strained command and support echelons, which faced critical undermanning in security, armaments, and communications; the absence of initial authorization for war reserve stocks of conventional munitions forced tac to scrounge; and the lack of airlift assets to support a major airborne drop necessitated the call up of reserve squadrons. on october at am edt, kennedy responded to khrushchev s telegram by stating that the us was forced into action after receiving repeated assurances that no offensive missiles were being placed in cuba, and when the assurances proved to be false, the deployment required the responses i have announced.... i hope that your government will take necessary action to permit a restoration of the earlier situation. a declassified map used by the us navy s atlantic fleet showing the position of american and soviet ships at the height of the crisis. blockade challenged edit at am edt on october , uss essex and uss gearing attempted to intercept bucharest but failed to do so. fairly certain that the tanker did not contain any military material, the us allowed it through the blockade. later that day, at pm, the commander of the blockade effort ordered the destroyer uss joseph p. kennedy jr. to intercept and board the lebanese freighter marucla. that took place the next day, and marucla was cleared through the blockade after its cargo was checked. at pm edt on october , william clements announced that the missiles in cuba were still actively being worked on. that report was later verified by a cia report that suggested there had been no slowdown at all. in response, kennedy issued security action memorandum , authorizing the loading of nuclear weapons onto aircraft under the command of saceur, which had the duty of carrying out first air strikes on the soviet union. during the day, the soviets responded to the blockade by turning back ships that were presumably carrying offensive weapons. stalemate edit the next morning, october , kennedy informed the excomm that he believed only an invasion would remove the missiles from cuba. he was persuaded to give the matter time and continue with both military and diplomatic pressure. he agreed and ordered the low level flights over the island to be increased from two per day to once every two hours. he also ordered a crash program to institute a new civil government in cuba if an invasion went ahead. at this point, the crisis was ostensibly at a stalemate. the soviets had shown no indication that they would back down and had made several comments to the contrary. the us had no reason to believe otherwise and was in the early stages of preparing for an invasion, along with a nuclear strike on the soviet union if it responded militarily, which was assumed. secret negotiations edit at pm edt on october , john a. scali of abc news had lunch with aleksandr fomin, the cover name of alexander feklisov, the kgb station chief in washington, at fomin s request. following the instructions of the politburo of the cpsu, fomin noted, war seems about to break out. he asked scali to use his contacts to talk to his high level friends at the state department to see if the us would be interested in a diplomatic solution. he suggested that the language of the deal would contain an assurance from the soviet union to remove the weapons under un supervision and that castro would publicly announce that he would not accept such weapons again in exchange for a public statement by the us that it would avoid invading cuba. the us responded by asking the brazilian government to pass a message to castro that the us would be unlikely to invade if the missiles were removed. .mw parser output .quotebox background color #f f f ;border px solid #aaa;box sizing border

tied the knot of war, because the more the two of us pull, the tighter that knot will be tied. and a moment may come when that knot will be tied so tight that even he who tied it will not have the strength to untie it, and then it will be necessary to cut that knot, and what that would mean is not for me to explain to you, because you yourself understand perfectly of what terrible forces our countries dispose. consequently, if there is no intention to tighten that knot and thereby to doom the world to the catastrophe of thermonuclear war, then let us not only relax the forces pulling on the ends of the rope, let us take measures to untie that knot. we are ready for this. — letter from chairman khrushchev to president kennedy, october , on october at pm edt, the state department started receiving a message that appeared to be written personally by khrushchev. it was saturday at am in moscow. the long letter took several minutes to arrive, and it took translators additional time to translate and transcribe it. robert f. kennedy described the letter as very long and emotional. khrushchev reiterated the basic outline that had been stated to scali earlier in the day i propose we, for our part, will declare that our ships bound for cuba are not carrying any armaments. you will declare that the united states will not invade cuba with its troops and will not support any other forces which might intend to invade cuba. then the necessity of the presence of our military specialists in cuba will disappear. at pm edt, news of fomin s offer to scali was finally heard and was interpreted as a set up for the arrival of khrushchev s letter. the letter was then considered official and accurate although it was later learned that fomin was almost certainly operating of his own accord without official backing. additional study of the letter was ordered and continued into the night. crisis continues edit direct aggression against cuba would mean nuclear war. the americans speak about such aggression as if they did not know or did not want to accept this fact. i have no doubt they would lose such a war.— che guevara, october s dvina with v v d missile (nato sa guideline) on a launcher. an installation similar to this one shot down major anderson s u over cuba. castro, on the other hand, was convinced that an invasion of cuba was soon at hand, and on october , he sent a telegram to khrushchev that appeared to call for a pre emptive nuclear strike on the us in case of attack. in a interview, castro expressed regret about his earlier stance on first use after i ve seen what i ve seen, and knowing what i know now, it wasn t worth it at all. castro also ordered all anti aircraft weapons in cuba to fire on any us aircraft the orders had been to fire only on groups of two or more. at am edt on october , the cia delivered a memo reporting that three of the four missile sites at san cristobal and the two sites at sagua la grande appeared to be fully operational. it also noted that the cuban military continued to organize for action but was under order not to initiate action unless attacked. citation needed at am edt on october , radio moscow began broadcasting a message from khrushchev. contrary to the letter of the night before, the message offered a new trade the missiles on cuba would be removed in exchange for the removal of the jupiter missiles from italy and turkey. at am edt, the executive committee met again to discuss the situation and came to the conclusion that the change in the message was because of internal debate between khrushchev and other party officials in the kremlin. kennedy realized that he would be in an insupportable position if this becomes khrushchev s proposal because the missiles in turkey were not militarily useful and were being removed anyway and it s gonna – to any man at the united nations or any other rational man, it will look like a very fair trade. bundy explained why khrushchev s public acquiescence could not be considered the current threat to peace is not in turkey, it is in cuba. mcnamara noted that another tanker, the grozny, was about miles ( km) out and should be intercepted. he also noted that they had not made the soviets aware of the blockade line and suggested relaying that information to them via u thant at the united nations. a lockheed u f, the high altitude reconnaissance type shot down over cuba, being refueled by a boeing kc q. the aircraft in was painted overall gray and carried usaf military markings and national insignia. while the meeting progressed, at am edt a new message began to arrive from khrushchev. the message stated, in part you are disturbed over cuba. you say that this disturbs you because it is ninety nine miles by sea from the coast of the united states of america. but... you have placed destructive missile weapons, which you call offensive, in italy and turkey, literally next to us.... i therefore make this proposal we are willing to remove from cuba the means which you regard as offensive.... your representatives will make a declaration to the effect that the united states... will remove its analogous means from turkey... and after that, persons entrusted by the united nations security council could inspect on the spot the fulfillment of the pledges made. the executive committee continued to meet through the day. throughout the crisis, turkey had repeatedly stated that it would be upset if the jupiter missiles were removed. italy s prime minister amintore fanfani, who was also foreign minister ad interim, offered to allow withdrawal of the missiles deployed in apulia as a bargaining chip. he gave the message to one of his most trusted friends, ettore bernabei, the general manager of rai tv, to convey to arthur m. schlesinger jr. bernabei was in new york to attend an international conference on satellite tv broadcasting. unknown to the soviets, the us regarded the jupiter missiles as obsolescent and already supplanted by the polaris nuclear ballistic submarine missiles. the engine of the lockheed u shot down over cuba on display at museum of the revolution in havana. on the morning of october , a u f (the third cia u a, modified for air to air refueling) piloted by usaf major rudolf anderson, departed its forward operating location at mccoy afb, florida. at approximately pm edt, the aircraft was struck by a s dvina (nato designation sa guideline) surface to air missile launched from cuba. the aircraft was shot down, and anderson was killed. the stress in negotiations between the soviets and the us intensified; it was only later believed that the decision to fire the missile was made locally by an undetermined soviet commander, acting on his own authority. later that day, at about pm edt, several us navy rf a crusader aircraft, on low level photoreconnaissance missions, were fired upon. on october , , khrushchev told his son sergei that the shooting down of anderson s u was by the cuban military at the direction of raul castro. at pm edt, kennedy recalled members of excomm to the white house and ordered that a message should immediately be sent to u thant asking the soviets to suspend work on the missiles while negotiations were carried out. during the meeting, general maxwell taylor delivered the news that the u had been shot down. kennedy had earlier claimed he would order an attack on such sites if fired upon, but he decided to not act unless another attack was made. forty years later, mcnamara said we had to send a u over to gain reconnaissance information on whether the soviet missiles were becoming operational. we believed that if the u was shot down that—the cubans didn t have capabilities to shoot it down, the soviets did—we believed if it was shot down, it would be shot down by a soviet surface to air missile unit, and that it would represent a decision by the soviets to escalate the conflict. and therefore, before we sent the u out, we agreed that if it was shot down we wouldn t meet, we d simply attack. it was shot down on friday.... fortunately, we changed our mind, we thought well, it might have been an accident, we won t attack. later we learned that khrushchev had reasoned just as we did we send over the u , if it was shot down, he reasoned we would believe it was an intentional escalation. and therefore, he issued orders to pliyev, the soviet commander in cuba, to instruct all of his batteries not to shoot down the u . note ellsberg said that robert kennedy (rfk) told him in that after the u was shot down and the pilot killed, he (rfk) told soviet ambassador dobrynin, you have drawn first blood ... . t he president had decided against advice ... not to respond militarily to that attack, but he dobrynin should know that if another plane was shot at, ... we would take out all the sams and antiaircraft ... . and that would almost surely be followed by an invasion. drafting response edit this section needs

news · newspapers · books · scholar · jstor (october ) (learn how and when to remove this template message) emissaries sent by both kennedy and khrushchev agreed to meet at the yenching palace chinese restaurant in the cleveland park neighborhood of washington, dc, on saturday evening, october . kennedy suggested to take khrushchev s offer to trade away the missiles. unknown to most members of the excomm, robert kennedy had been meeting with the soviet ambassador dobrynin in washington to discover whether the intentions were genuine. the excomm was generally against the proposal because it would undermine nato s authority, and the turkish government had repeatedly stated it was against any such trade. as the meeting progressed, a new plan emerged, and kennedy was slowly persuaded. the new plan called for him to ignore the latest message and instead to return to khrushchev s earlier one. kennedy was initially hesitant, feeling that khrushchev would no longer accept the deal because a new one had been offered, but llewellyn thompson argued that it was still possible. white house special counsel and adviser ted sorensen and robert kennedy left the meeting and returned minutes later, with a draft letter to that effect. the president made several changes, had it typed, and sent it. after the excomm meeting, a smaller meeting continued in the oval office. the group argued that the letter should be underscored with an oral message to dobrynin that stated that if the missiles were not withdrawn, military action would be used to remove them. rusk added one proviso that no part of the language of the deal would mention turkey, but there would be an understanding that the missiles would be removed voluntarily in the immediate aftermath. the president agreed, and the message was sent. october , excomm meeting held in the white house cabinet room. president kennedy, robert mcnamara and dean rusk. at rusk s request, fomin and scali met again. scali asked why the two letters from khrushchev were so different, and fomin claimed it was because of poor communications. scali replied that the claim was not credible and shouted that he thought it was a stinking double cross. he went on to claim that an invasion was only hours away, and fomin stated that a response to the us message was expected from khrushchev shortly and urged scali to tell the state department that no treachery was intended. scali said that he did not think anyone would believe him, but he agreed to deliver the message. the two went their separate ways, and scali immediately typed out a memo for the excomm. within the us establishment, it was well understood that ignoring the second offer and returning to the first put khrushchev in a terrible position. military preparations continued, and all active duty air force personnel were recalled to their bases for possible action. robert kennedy later recalled the mood we had not abandoned all hope, but what hope there was now rested with khrushchev s revising his course within the next few hours. it was a hope, not an expectation. the expectation was military confrontation by tuesday (october ), and possibly tomorrow (october ) .... at pm edt, the letter drafted earlier in the day was delivered. the message read, as i read your letter, the key elements of your proposals—which seem generally acceptable as i understand them—are as follows ) you would agree to remove these weapons systems from cuba under appropriate united nations observation and supervision; and undertake, with suitable safe guards, to halt the further introduction of such weapon systems into cuba. ) we, on our part, would agree—upon the establishment of adequate arrangements through the united nations, to ensure the carrying out and continuation of these commitments (a) to remove promptly the quarantine measures now in effect and (b) to give assurances against the invasion of cuba. the letter was also released directly to the press to ensure it could not be delayed. with the letter delivered, a deal was on the table. as robert kennedy noted, there was little expectation it would be accepted. at pm edt, the excomm met again to review the actions for the following day. plans were drawn up for air strikes on the missile sites as well as other economic targets, notably petroleum storage. mcnamara stated that they had to have two things ready a government for cuba, because we re going to need one; and secondly, plans for how to respond to the soviet union in europe, because sure as hell they re going to do something there. at am edt, on october , the us informed its nato allies that the situation is growing shorter.... the united states may find it necessary within a very short time in its interest and that of its fellow nations in the western hemisphere to take whatever military action may be necessary. to add to the concern, at am, the cia reported that all missiles in cuba were ready for action. a us navy hss seabat helicopter hovers over soviet submarine b , forced to the surface by us naval forces in the caribbean near cuba (october – , ) on october , khrushchev also received a letter from castro, what is now known as the armageddon letter (dated the day before), which was interpreted as urging the use of nuclear force in the event of an attack on cuba i believe the imperialists aggressiveness is extremely dangerous and if they actually carry out the brutal act of invading cuba in violation of international law and morality, that would be the moment to eliminate such danger forever through an act of clear legitimate defense, however harsh and terrible the solution would be, castro wrote. averted nuclear launch edit later that same day, what the white house later called black saturday, the us navy dropped a series of signaling depth charges (practice depth charges the size of hand grenades ) on a soviet submarine (b ) at the blockade line, unaware that it was armed with a nuclear tipped torpedo with orders that allowed it to be used if the submarine was damaged by depth charges or surface fire. as the submarine was too deep to monitor any radio traffic, the captain of the b , valentin grigorievitch savitsky, decided that a war might already have started and wanted to launch a nuclear torpedo. the decision to launch these required agreement from all three officers on board, but one of them, vasili arkhipov, objected and so the nuclear launch was narrowly averted. on the same day a u spy plane made an accidental, unauthorized ninety minute overflight of the soviet union s far eastern coast. the soviets responded by scrambling mig fighters from wrangel island; in turn, the americans launched f fighters armed with nuclear air to air missiles over the bering sea. crisis ends edit on saturday, october , after much deliberation between the soviet union and kennedy s cabinet, kennedy secretly agreed to remove all missiles set in turkey and possibly southern italy, the former on the border of the soviet union, in exchange for khrushchev removing all missiles in cuba. there is some dispute as to whether removing the missiles from italy was part of the secret agreement. khrushchev wrote in his memoirs that it was, and when the crisis had ended mcnamara gave the order to dismantle the missiles in both italy and turkey. at this point, khrushchev knew things the us did not first, that the shooting down of the u by a soviet missile violated direct orders from moscow, and cuban antiaircraft fire against other us reconnaissance aircraft also violated direct orders from khrushchev to castro. second, the soviets already had nuclear warheads on cuba that the us did not then believe were there. third, the soviets and cubans on the island would almost certainly have responded to an invasion by using those nuclear weapons, even though castro believed that every human in cuba would likely die as a result. khrushchev also knew but may not have considered the fact that he had submarines armed with nuclear weapons that the us navy may not have known about. khrushchev knew he was losing control. president kennedy had been told in early that a nuclear war would likely kill a third of humanity, with most or all of those deaths concentrated in the us, the ussr, europe and china; khrushchev may well have received similar reports from his military. with this background, when khrushchev heard kennedy s threats relayed by robert kennedy to soviet ambassador dobrynin, he immediately drafted his acceptance of kennedy s latest terms from his dacha without involving the politburo, as he had previously, and had them immediately broadcast over radio moscow, which he believed the us would hear. in that broadcast at am est, on october , khrushchev stated that the soviet government, in addition to previously issued instructions on the cessation of further work at the building sites for the weapons, has issued a new order on the dismantling of the weapons which you describe as offensive and their crating and return to the soviet union. at am, october , kennedy first learned of khrushchev s solution to the crisis with the us removing the jupiters in turkey and the soviets would remove the rockets from cuba. khrushchev had made the offer in a public statement for the world to hear. despite almost solid opposition from his senior advisers, kennedy quickly embraced the soviet offer. this is a pretty good play of his, kennedy said, according to a tape recording that he made secretly of the cabinet room meeting. kennedy had deployed the jupiters in march of the year, causing a stream of angry outbursts from khrushchev. most people will think this is a rather even trade and we ought to take advantage of it, kennedy said. vice president lyndon johnson was the first to endorse the missile swap but others continued to oppose the offer. finally, kennedy ended the debate. we can t very well invade cuba with all its toil and blood, kennedy said, when we could have gotten them out by making a deal on the same missiles on turkey. if that s part of the record, then you don t have a very good war. kennedy immediately responded, issuing a statement calling the letter an important and constructive contribution to peace. he continued this with a formal letter i consider my letter to you of october twenty seventh and your reply of today as firm undertakings on the part of both our governments which should be promptly carried out.... the us will make a statement in the framework of the security council in reference to cuba as follows it will declare that the united states of america will respect the inviolability of cuban borders, its sovereignty, that it take the pledge not to interfere in internal affairs, not to intrude themselves and not to permit our territory to be used as a bridgehead for the invasion of cuba, and will restrain those who would plan to carry an aggression against cuba, either from us territory or from the territory of other countries neighboring to cuba. kennedy s planned statement would also contain suggestions he had received from his adviser schlesinger jr. in a memorandum for the president describing the post mortem on cuba. kennedy s oval office telephone conversation with eisenhower soon after khrushchev s message arrived revealed that the president was planning to use the cuban missile crisis to escalate tensions with khrushchev and in the long run, cuba as well. the president also claimed that he thought the crisis would result in direct military confrontations in berlin by the end of the next month. he also claimed in his conversation with eisenhower that the soviet leader had offered to withdraw from cuba in exchange for the withdrawal of missiles from turkey and that while the kennedy administration had agreed not to invade cuba, they were only in process of determining khrushchev s offer to withdraw from turkey. when former us president harry truman called president kennedy the day of khrushchev s offer, the president informed him that his administration had rejected the soviet leader s offer to withdraw missiles from turkey and was planning on using the soviet setback in cuba to escalate tensions in berlin. removal of missiles in cuba november , – nara – the us continued the blockade; in the following days, aerial reconnaissance proved that the soviets were making progress in removing the missile systems. the missiles and their support equipment were loaded onto eight soviet ships. on november , , kennedy addressed the us via radio and television broadcasts regarding the dismantlement process of the soviet r missile bases located in the caribbean region. the ships left cuba on november to . the us made a final visual check as each of the ships passed the blockade line. further diplomatic efforts were required to remove the soviet il bombers, and they were loaded on three soviet ships on december and . concurrent with the soviet commitment on the il s, the us government announced the end of the blockade from pm est on november , . at the time when the kennedy administration thought that the cuban missile crisis was resolved, nuclear tactical rockets stayed in cuba since they were not part of the kennedy khrushchev understandings and the americans did not know about them. the soviets changed their minds, fearing possible future cuban militant steps, and on november , , deputy premier of the soviet union anastas mikoyan told castro that the rockets with the nuclear warheads were being removed as well. in his negotiations with the soviet ambassador anatoly dobrynin, robert kennedy informally proposed that the jupiter missiles in turkey would be removed within a short time after this crisis was over. the last us missiles were disassembled by april , and were flown out of turkey soon afterward. the practical effect of the kennedy khrushchev pact was that the us would not invade cuba. it is possible that khrushchev placed the missiles in cuba only to get kennedy to remove the missiles from italy and turkey and that the soviets had no intention of resorting to nuclear war if they were out gunned by the us. because the withdrawal of the jupiter missiles from nato bases in italy and turkey was not made public at the time, khrushchev appeared to have lost the conflict and become weakened. the perception was that kennedy had won the contest between the superpowers and that khrushchev had been humiliated. both kennedy and khrushchev took every step to avoid full conflict despite pressures from their respective governments. khrushchev held power for another two years. – nuclear forces edit by the time of the crisis in october , total nuclear weapons in each country s stockpile numbered approximately , for the united states and , for the soviet union. at the peak of the crisis, the u.s. had some , nuclear weapons ready to be used on command with a combined yield of approximately , megatons. the soviets had considerably less strategic firepower at their disposal (some bombs and warheads), lacking submarine based weapons in a position to threaten the u.s. mainland and having most of their intercontinental delivery systems based on bombers that would have difficulty penetrating north american air defense systems. the u.s. had approximately , nuclear weapons deployed in europe, most of which were tactical weapons such as nuclear artillery, with around of them for ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and aircraft; the soviets had more than similar weapons in europe. united

missile. the us secretly agreed to withdraw the missiles from italy and turkey. soviet leadership edit the enormity of how close the world came to thermonuclear war impelled khrushchev to propose a far reaching easing of tensions with the us. in a letter to president kennedy dated october , , khrushchev outlined a range of bold initiatives to forestall the possibility of a further nuclear crisis, including proposing a non aggression treaty between the north atlantic treaty organization (nato) and the warsaw pact or even disbanding these military blocs, a treaty to cease all nuclear weapons testing and even the elimination of all nuclear weapons, resolution of the hot button issue of germany by both east and west formally accepting the existence of west germany and east germany, and us recognition of the government of mainland china. the letter invited counter proposals and further exploration of these and other issues through peaceful negotiations. khrushchev invited norman cousins, the editor of a major us periodical and an anti nuclear weapons activist, to serve as liaison with president kennedy, and cousins met with khrushchev for four hours in december . kennedy s response to khrushchev s proposals was lukewarm but kennedy expressed to cousins that he felt constrained in exploring these issues due to pressure from hardliners in the us national security apparatus. the us and the ussr did shortly thereafter agree on a treaty banning atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, known as the partial nuclear test ban treaty . further after the crisis, the us and the soviet union created the moscow–washington hotline, a direct communications link between moscow and washington. the purpose was to have a way that the leaders of the two cold war countries could communicate directly to solve such a crisis. the compromise embarrassed khrushchev and the soviet union because the withdrawal of us missiles from italy and turkey was a secret deal between kennedy and khrushchev. khrushchev went to kennedy as he thought that the crisis was getting out of hand, but the soviets were seen as retreating from circumstances that they had started. khrushchev s fall from power two years later was in part because of the soviet politburo s embarrassment at both khrushchev s eventual concessions to the us and this ineptitude in precipitating the crisis in the first place. according to dobrynin, the top soviet leadership took the cuban outcome as a blow to its prestige bordering on humiliation. cuban leadership edit cuba perceived the outcome as a betrayal by the soviets, as decisions on how to resolve the crisis had been made exclusively by kennedy and khrushchev. castro was especially upset that certain issues of interest to cuba, such as the status of the us naval base in guantánamo, were not addressed. that caused cuban–soviet relations to deteriorate for years to come. on the other hand, cuba continued to be protected from invasion. us leadership edit the worldwide us forces defcon status was returned to defcon on november , . general curtis lemay told the president that the resolution of the crisis was the greatest defeat in our history ; his was a minority position. he had pressed for an immediate invasion of cuba as soon as the crisis began and still favored invading cuba even after the soviets had withdrawn their missiles. twenty five years later, lemay still believed that we could have gotten not only the missiles out of cuba, we could have gotten the communists out of cuba at that time. critics, including seymour melman, and seymour hersh suggested that the cuban missile crisis encouraged the united states use of military means, such as the case in the later vietnam war. human casualties edit u pilot anderson s body was returned to the us and was buried with full military honors in south carolina. he was the first recipient of the newly created air force cross, which was awarded posthumously. although anderson was the only combatant fatality during the crisis, crew members of three reconnaissance boeing rb stratojets of the th strategic reconnaissance wing were also killed in crashes during the period between september and november , . seven crew died when a military air transport service boeing c b stratolifter delivering ammunition to guantanamo bay naval base stalled and crashed on approach on october . later revelations edit schlesinger, a historian and adviser to kennedy, told national public radio in an interview on october , that castro did not want the missiles, but khrushchev pressured castro to accept them. castro was not completely happy with the idea, but the cuban national directorate of the revolution accepted them, both to protect cuba against us attack and to aid the soviet union. schlesinger believed that when the missiles were withdrawn, castro was more angry with khrushchev than with kennedy because khrushchev had not consulted castro before deciding to remove them. note although castro was infuriated by khrushchev, he planned on striking the us with remaining missiles if an invasion of the island occurred. in early , it was confirmed that soviet forces in cuba had, when the crisis broke, already received tactical nuclear warheads for their artillery rockets and il bombers. castro stated that he would have recommended their use if the us invaded despite cuba being destroyed. arguably, the most dangerous moment in the crisis was not recognized until the cuban missile crisis havana conference, in october . attended by many of the veterans of the crisis, they all learned that on october , , uss beale had tracked and dropped signaling depth charges (the size of hand grenades) on b , a soviet project (nato designation foxtrot) submarine. unknown to the us, it was armed with a kiloton nuclear torpedo. running out of air, the soviet submarine was surrounded by american warships and desperately needed to surface. an argument broke out among three officers aboard b , including submarine captain valentin savitsky, political officer ivan semonovich maslennikov, and deputy brigade commander captain nd rank (us navy commander rank equivalent) vasili arkhipov. an exhausted savitsky became furious and ordered that the nuclear torpedo on board be made combat ready. accounts differ about whether arkhipov convinced savitsky not to make the attack or whether savitsky himself finally concluded that the only reasonable choice left open to him was to come to the surface. , during the conference, mcnamara stated that nuclear war had come much closer than people had thought. thomas blanton, director of the national security archive, said, a guy called vasili arkhipov saved the world. fifty years after the crisis, graham t. allison wrote fifty years ago, the cuban missile crisis brought the world to the brink of nuclear disaster. during the standoff, us president john f. kennedy thought the chance of escalation to war was between in and even, and what we have learned in later decades has done nothing to lengthen those odds. we now know, for example, that in addition to nuclear armed ballistic missiles, the soviet union had deployed tactical nuclear weapons to cuba, and the local soviet commander there could have launched these weapons without additional codes or commands from moscow. the us air strike and invasion that were scheduled for the third week of the confrontation would likely have triggered a nuclear response against american ships and troops, and perhaps even miami. the resulting war might have led to the deaths of over million americans and over million russians. bbc journalist joe matthews published the story, on october , , behind the tactical nuclear warheads mentioned by graham allison in the excerpt above. khrushchev feared that castro s hurt pride and widespread cuban indignation over the concessions he had made to kennedy might lead to a breakdown of the agreement between the soviet union and the us. to prevent that, khrushchev decided to offer to give cuba more than tactical nuclear weapons that had been shipped to cuba along with the long range missiles but, crucially, had escaped the notice of us intelligence. khrushchev determined that because the americans had not listed the missiles on their list of demands, keeping them in cuba would be in the soviet union s interests. anastas mikoyan was tasked with the negotiations with castro over the missile transfer deal that was designed to prevent a breakdown in the relations between cuba and the soviet union. while in havana, mikoyan witnessed the mood swings and paranoia of castro, who was convinced that moscow had made the agreement with the us at the expense of cuba s defense. mikoyan, on his own initiative, decided that castro and his military not be given control of weapons with an explosive force equal to hiroshima sized bombs under any circumstances. he defused the seemingly intractable situation, which risked re escalating the crisis, on november , . during a tense, four hour meeting, mikoyan convinced castro that despite moscow s desire to help, it would be in breach of an unpublished soviet law, which did not actually exist, to transfer the missiles permanently into cuban hands and provide them with an independent nuclear deterrent. castro was forced to give way and, much to the relief of khrushchev and the rest of the soviet government, the tactical nuclear weapons were crated and returned by sea to the soviet union during december . in popular culture edit the american popular media, especially television, made frequent use of the events of the missile crisis and both fictional and documentary forms. jim willis includes the crisis as one of the media moments that changed america. sheldon stern finds that a half century later there are still many misconceptions, half truths, and outright lies that have shaped media versions of what happened in the white house during those harrowing two weeks. historian william cohn argued in a article that television programs are typically the main source used by the american public to know about and interpret the past. according to cold war historian andrei kozovoi, the soviet media proved somewhat disorganized as it was unable to generate a coherent popular history. khrushchev lost power and was airbrushed out of the story. cuba was no longer portrayed as a heroic david against the american goliath. one contradiction that pervaded the soviet media campaign was between the pacifistic rhetoric of the peace movement that emphasizes the horrors of nuclear war and the militancy of the need to prepare soviets for war against american aggression. media representations edit this section does not

november , ), commonly referred to by his initials jfk, was an american politician and journalist who served as the th president of the united states from january until his assassination in november . he served at the height of the cold war, and the majority of his presidency dealt with managing relations with the soviet union. a member of the democratic party, kennedy represented massachusetts in the u.s. house of representatives and senate prior to becoming president. kennedy was born in brookline, massachusetts, the second child of joseph p. kennedy sr. and rose kennedy. he graduated from harvard university in and joined the u.s. naval reserve the following year. during world war ii, he commanded a series of pt boats in the pacific theater and earned the navy and marine corps medal for his service. after the war, kennedy represented the th congressional district of massachusetts in the u.s. house of representatives from to . he was subsequently elected to the u.s. senate and served as the junior senator from massachusetts from to . while in the senate, he published his book entitled profiles in courage, which won a pulitzer prize for biography. in the presidential election, kennedy narrowly defeated republican opponent richard nixon, who was the incumbent vice president. at age , he became the second youngest man to serve as president (after theodore roosevelt), the youngest man to be elected as u.s. president, as well as the only roman catholic to occupy that office. he was also the first president to have served in the u.s. navy. kennedy s time in office was marked by high tensions with communist states in the cold war. he increased the number of american military advisers in south vietnam by a factor of over president dwight d. eisenhower. in april , he authorized a failed joint cia attempt to overthrow the cuban government of fidel castro in the bay of pigs invasion. he subsequently rejected operation northwoods plans by the joint chiefs of staff to orchestrate false flag attacks on american soil in order to gain public approval for a war against cuba. in october , u.s. spy planes discovered that soviet missile bases had been deployed in cuba; the resulting period of tensions, termed the cuban missile crisis, nearly resulted in the breakout of a global thermonuclear conflict. domestically, kennedy presided over the establishment of the peace corps and supported the civil rights movement, but was only somewhat successful in passing his new frontier domestic policies. on november , , kennedy was assassinated in dallas, texas. pursuant to the presidential succession act, vice president lyndon b. johnson was sworn in as president later that day. marxist lee harvey oswald was arrested for the state crime, but he was never prosecuted due to his killing by jack ruby two days later; ruby was sentenced to death and died while the sentence was on appeal in . both the fbi and the warren commission officially concluded that oswald had acted alone in the assassination, but various groups challenged the findings of the warren report and believed that kennedy was the victim of a conspiracy. after kennedy s death, congress enacted many of his proposals, including the civil rights and the revenue acts of . kennedy continues to rank highly in historians polls of u.s. presidents and with the general public. his personal life has also been the focus of considerable public fascination, particularly following revelations regarding his lifelong health ailments and alleged extra marital affairs. his average approval rating of % is the highest of any president in gallup s history of systematically measuring job approval. .mw parser output .toclimit .toclevel ul,.mw parser output .toclimit .toclevel ul,.mw parser output .toclimit

ranch outside benson, arizona. it is reported that ranchman jack speiden worked both brothers very hard . in september , kennedy enrolled at harvard college and his application essay stated the reasons that i have for wishing to go to harvard are several. i feel that harvard can give me a better background and a better liberal education than any other university. i have always wanted to go there, as i have felt that it is not just another college, but is a university with something definite to offer. then too, i would like to go to the same college as my father. to be a harvard man is an enviable distinction, and one that i sincerely hope i shall attain. he produced that year s annual freshman smoker , called by a reviewer an elaborate entertainment, which included in its cast

of war on germany. kennedy was sent as his father s representative to help with arrangements for american survivors of the ss athenia before flying back to the u.s. from foynes, ireland, to port washington, new york, on his first transatlantic flight. when kennedy was an upperclassman at harvard, he began to take his studies more seriously and developed an interest in political philosophy. he made the dean s list in his junior year. in , kennedy completed his thesis, appeasement in munich , about british participation in the munich agreement. the thesis eventually became a bestseller under the title why england slept. in addition to addressing britain s failure to strengthen its military in the lead up to world war ii, the book also called for an anglo american alliance against the rising totalitarian powers. while kennedy became increasingly supportive of u.s. intervention in world war ii, his father s isolationist beliefs resulted in the latter s dismissal as ambassador to the united kingdom, creating a split between the kennedy and roosevelt families. in , kennedy graduated cum laude from harvard college with a bachelor of arts in government, concentrating on international affairs. that fall, he enrolled at the stanford graduate school of business and audited classes there. in early , kennedy left and helped his father write a memoir of his time as an american ambassador. he then traveled throughout south america; his itinerary included colombia, ecuador and peru. u.s. navy reserve ( – ) main article motor torpedo boat pt in , kennedy attempted to enter the

then voluntarily entered the motor torpedo boat squadrons training center in melville, rhode island. on october , he was promoted to lieutenant junior grade. in early november, kennedy was still mourning the death of his close, childhood friend, marine corps second lieutenant george houk mead jr., who had been killed in action at guadalcanal that august and posthumously awarded the navy cross for his bravery. accompanied by a female acquaintance from a wealthy newport family, the couple had stopped in middletown, rhode island at the cemetery where the decorated, naval spy, commander hugo w. koehler, usn, had been buried the previous year. ambling around the plots near the tiny st. columba s chapel, kennedy paused over koehler s white granite cross grave marker and pondered his own mortality, hoping out loud that when his time came, he would not have to die without religion. but these things can t be faked, he added. there s no bluffing. two decades later, kennedy and koehler s stepson, u.s. senator claiborne pell had become good friends and political allies, although they had been acquaintances since the mid s during their salad days on the same newport debutante party circuit and when pell had dated kathleen ( kick ) kennedy. kennedy completed his training on december and was assigned to motor torpedo squadron four. his first command was pt from december , , until february , it was a patrol torpedo (pt) boat used for training while kennedy was an instructor at melville. he then led three huckins pt boats—pt , pt , and pt , which were being relocated from mtbron in melville, rhode island, back to jacksonville, florida, and the new mtbron (formed february , ). during the trip south, he was hospitalized briefly in jacksonville after diving into the cold water to unfoul a propeller. thereafter, kennedy was assigned duty in panama and later in the pacific theater, where he eventually commanded two more pt boats. commanding the pt kennedy on his navy patrol boat, the pt , in april , kennedy was assigned to motor torpedo squadron two. on april , he took command of pt , which was based at the time on tulagi island in the solomons. on the night of august – , pt was on its st mission with a total of fourteen other pt s ordered to block or repel four japanese destroyers and float planes carrying food, supplies, and japanese soldiers to the vila plantation garrison on the southern tip of the solomon s kolombangara island. intelligence had been sent to kennedy s base commander, commander thomas g. warfield expecting the arrival of the large japanese naval force that would pass on the evening of august . of the torpedoes fired that night by eight of the american pt s, not one hit the japanese convoy. on that dark and moonless night, kennedy spotted a japanese destroyer heading north on its return from the base of kolombangara around a.m., and attempted to turn to attack, when pt was rammed suddenly at an angle and cut in half by the destroyer amagiri, costing two pt crew members their lives. kennedy gathered around the wreckage his surviving ten crew members to vote on whether to fight or surrender . kennedy stated there s nothing in the book about a situation like this. a lot of you men have families and some of you have children. what do you want to do? i have nothing to lose. shunning surrender, around p.m. on august , the men swam towards plum pudding island . miles ( . km) southwest of the remains of the pt . despite re injuring his back in the collision, kennedy towed a badly burned crewman through the water to the island with a life jacket strap clenched between his teeth. kennedy made an additional two mile swim the night of august , , to ferguson passage to attempt to hail a passing american pt boat to expedite his crew s rescue and attempted to make the trip on a subsequent night, in a damaged canoe found on naru island where he had swum with ensign george ross to look for food. on august , he and lenny thom assisted his injured and hungry crew on a demanding swim . miles ( . km) southeast to olasana island, which was visible to the crew from their desolate home on plum pudding island. they swam against a strong current, and once again kennedy towed the badly burned motor machinist pappy macmahon by his life vest. the somewhat larger olasana island had ripe coconut trees, but still no fresh water. on the following day, august , kennedy and ensign george ross made the one hour swim to naru island, an additional distance of about . miles ( . km) southwest, in search of help and food. kennedy and ross found a small canoe, packages of crackers, candy and a fifty gallon drum of drinkable water left by the japanese, which kennedy paddled another half mile back to olasana in the acquired canoe to provide his hungry crew. lieutenant bud liebenow, a friend and former tentmate of kennedy s, rescued kennedy and his crew on olasana island on august , aboard his ship, the pt , with the help of coast watcher lieutenant reginald evans and several native coast watchers, particularly biuku gasa and eroni kumana. commanding the pt taking only a month to recover, on september , , kennedy returned to duty and took command of the pt , first removing the torpedo tubes and depth charges and refitting her in one month into a heavily armed gunboat bristling with two large automatic cal and ten automatic caliber guns. the plan was to attach one gunboat to each pt boat section to add gun range and power against barges and shore batteries which the encountered on several occasions in mid october through mid november. on october , kennedy was promoted to full lieutenant. on november , kennedy s pt took part with two other pt s in the successful rescue of marines. the acted as a shield from shore fire and protected them as they escaped on two rescue landing craft at the base of the warrior river at choiseul island, taking ten marines aboard and delivering them to safety.

presented the navy and marine corps medal for his heroic actions on august – , , and the purple heart medal for his back injury while on pt . beginning in january , kennedy spent three more months recovering from his back injury at castle hot springs, a resort and temporary military hospital in arizona. after the war, kennedy felt that the medal he had received for heroism was not a combat award and asked that he be reconsidered for the silver star medal for which he had been recommended initially. his father also requested the silver star, which is awarded for gallantry in action, for his son. in , the department of the navy offered kennedy a bronze star medal in recognition of his meritorious service, which he declined. kennedy s two original medals are currently on display at the john f. kennedy presidential library and museum. on august , , kennedy s older brother, joe jr., a navy pilot, was killed while volunteering for a special and hazardous air mission. his explosive laden plane blew up when the plane s bombs detonated prematurely while the aircraft was flying over the english channel. on march , , kennedy retired from the navy reserve on physical disability and was honorably discharged with the full rank of lieutenant. when later asked how he became a war hero, kennedy joked it was easy. they cut my pt boat in half. military awards kennedy s military

congress that year. he served in the house for six years, joining the influential education and labor committee and the veterans affairs committee. he concentrated his attention on international affairs, supporting the truman doctrine as the appropriate response to the emerging cold war. he also supported public housing and opposed the labor management relations act of , which restricted the

convalescence in , he published profiles in courage, a book about u.s. senators who risked their careers for their personal beliefs, for which he won the pulitzer prize for biography in . rumors that this work was co written by his close adviser and speechwriter, ted sorensen, were confirmed in sorensen s autobiography. at the democratic national convention, senator kennedy gave the nominating speech for the party s presidential nominee, adlai stevenson ii. stevenson let the convention select the vice presidential nominee. kennedy finished second in the balloting, losing to senator estes kefauver of tennessee but receiving national exposure as a result. one of the matters demanding kennedy s attention in the senate was president eisenhower s bill for the civil rights act of . kennedy cast a procedural vote on this, which was considered by some as an appeasement of southern democratic opponents of the bill. kennedy did vote for title iii of the act, which would have given the attorney general powers to enjoin, but majority leader lyndon b. johnson agreed to let the provision die as a compromise measure. kennedy also voted for title iv, termed the jury trial amendment . many civil rights advocates at the time criticized that vote as one which would weaken the act. a final compromise bill, which kennedy supported, was passed in september . the following year, kennedy authored a nation of immigrants (later published in ), which analyzed the importance of immigration in the country s history as well as proposals to re evaluate immigration law. jack paar interviews senator kennedy on the tonight show ( ) in , kennedy was re elected to a second term in the senate, defeating his republican opponent, boston lawyer vincent j. celeste, by a wide margin of , votes; this represented the largest ever margin in massachusetts politics. it was during his re election campaign that kennedy s press secretary at the time, robert e. thompson, put together a film entitled the u.s. senator john f. kennedy story, which exhibited a day in the life of the senator and showcased his family life as well as the inner workings of his office. it was the most comprehensive film produced about kennedy up to that time. in the aftermath of his re election, kennedy began preparing to run for president in . while kennedy s father was a strong supporter of senator joseph mccarthy, mccarthy was also a friend of the kennedy family. bobby kennedy worked for mccarthy s subcommittee, and mccarthy dated kennedy sister patricia. in , the senate voted to censure mccarthy, and kennedy drafted a speech supporting the censure. however, it was not delivered because kennedy was hospitalized at the time. the speech had the potential of putting kennedy in the position of participating procedurally by pairing his vote against that of another senator. although kennedy never indicated how he would have voted, the episode damaged his support among members of the liberal community, including eleanor roosevelt, in the and elections. presidential election main articles democratic party presidential primaries and united states presidential election kennedy campaigns with his wife jacqueline in appleton, wisconsin, march on january , , kennedy announced his candidacy for the democratic presidential nomination. though some questioned kennedy s youth and experience, his charisma and eloquence earned him numerous supporters. his greatest obstacle to winning the nomination may have been his religion. many americans held anti catholic attitudes, but kennedy s vocal support of the separation of church and state helped defuse the situation. his religion also helped him win a devoted following among many catholic voters. kennedy faced several potential challengers for the democratic nomination, including senate majority leader lyndon b. johnson, adlai stevenson ii, and senator hubert humphrey. kennedy traveled extensively to build his support among democratic elites and voters. at the time, party officials controlled most of the delegates, but several states also held primaries, and kennedy sought to win several primaries to boost his chances of winning the nomination. in his first major test, kennedy won the wisconsin primary, effectively ending humphrey s hopes of winning the presidency. nonetheless, kennedy and humphrey faced each other in a competitive west virginia primary in which kennedy could not benefit from a catholic bloc, as he had in wisconsin. kennedy won the west virginia primary, impressing many in the party, but at the start of the democratic national convention, it was unclear as to whether he would win the nomination. kennedy and richard nixon participate in the nation s first televised presidential debate, washington, d.c., when kennedy entered the convention, he had the most delegates, but not enough to ensure that he would win the nomination. stevenson—the and presidential nominee—remained very popular in the party, while johnson also hoped to win the nomination with the support from party leaders. kennedy s candidacy also faced opposition from former president harry s. truman, who was concerned about kennedy s lack of experience. kennedy knew that a second ballot could give the nomination to johnson or someone else, and his well organized campaign was able to earn the support of just enough delegates to win the presidential nomination on the first ballot. kennedy ignored the opposition of his brother, who wanted him to choose labor leader walter reuther, and other liberal supporters when he chose johnson as his vice presidential nominee. he believed that the texas senator could help him win support from the south. the choice infuriated many in labor. afl cio president george meany called johnson the arch foe of labor, while illinois afl cio president reuben soderstrom asserted kennedy had made chumps out of leaders of the american labor movement. in accepting the presidential nomination, kennedy gave his well known new frontier speech, saying, for the problems are not all solved and the battles are not all won—and we stand today on the edge of a new frontier. ... but the new frontier of which i speak is not a set of promises—it is a set of challenges. it sums up not what i intend to offer the american people, but what i intend to ask of them. outgoing president dwight d. eisenhower meets with president elect john f. kennedy on december , at the start of the fall general election campaign, republican nominee and incumbent vice president richard nixon held a six point lead in the polls. major issues included how to get the economy moving again, kennedy s roman catholicism, the cuban revolution, and whether the space and missile programs of the soviet union had surpassed those of the u.s. to address fears that his being catholic would impact his decision making, he famously told the greater houston ministerial association on september , i am not the catholic candidate for president. i am the democratic party candidate for president who also happens to be a catholic. i do not speak for my church on public matters – and the church does not speak for me. kennedy questioned rhetorically whether one quarter of americans were relegated to second class citizenship just because they were catholic, and once stated that n o one asked me my religion serving the navy in the south pacific. between september and october, kennedy squared off against nixon in the first televised presidential debates in u.s. history. during these programs, nixon had an injured leg, five o clock shadow , and was perspiring, making him look tense and uncomfortable. conversely, kennedy wore makeup and appeared relaxed, which helped the large television audience to view him as the winner. on average radio listeners thought that nixon had won or that the debates were a draw. the debates are now considered a milestone in american political history—the point at which the medium of television began to play a dominant role in politics. electoral vote results kennedy s campaign gained momentum after the first debate, and he pulled slightly ahead of nixon in most polls. on election day, kennedy defeated nixon in one of the closest presidential elections of the th century. in the national popular vote, by most accounts, kennedy led nixon by just two tenths of one percent ( . % to . %), while in the electoral college, he won votes to nixon s ( were needed to win). fourteen electors from mississippi and alabama refused to support kennedy because of his support for the civil rights movement; they voted for senator harry f. byrd of virginia, as did an elector from oklahoma. kennedy became the youngest person ( ) ever elected to the presidency, though

the presidential oath of office administered by chief justice earl warren on january , , at the capitol. john f. kennedy was sworn in as the th president at noon on january , . in his inaugural address, he spoke of the need for all americans to be active citizens, famously saying ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country. he asked the nations of the world to join together to fight what he called the common enemies of man tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself. he added all this will not be finished in the first one hundred days. nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days, nor in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. but let us begin. in closing, he expanded on his desire for greater internationalism finally, whether you are citizens of america or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you. the address reflected kennedy s confidence that his administration would chart a historically significant course in both domestic policy and foreign affairs. the contrast between this optimistic vision and the pressures of managing daily political realities at home and abroad would be one of the main tensions running through the early years of his administration. john f. kennedy speaking at rice university in houston on september , . lyndon johnson can be seen behind him. kennedy brought to the white house a contrast in organization compared to the decision making structure of former general eisenhower, and he wasted no time in scrapping eisenhower s methods. kennedy preferred the organizational structure of a wheel with all the spokes leading to the president. he was ready and willing to make the increased number of quick decisions required in such an environment. he selected a mixture of experienced and inexperienced people to serve in his cabinet. we can learn our jobs together , he stated. much to the chagrin of his economic advisors, who wanted him to reduce taxes, kennedy quickly agreed to a balanced budget pledge. this was needed in exchange for votes to expand the membership of the house rules committee in order to give the democrats a majority in setting the legislative agenda. kennedy focused on immediate and specific issues facing the administration, and quickly voiced his impatience with pondering of deeper meanings. deputy national security advisor walt whitman rostow once began a diatribe about the growth of communism, and kennedy abruptly cut him off, asking, what do you want me to do about that today? kennedy approved defense secretary robert mcnamara s controversial decision to award the contract for the f tfx (tactical fighter experimental) fighter bomber to general dynamics (the choice of the civilian defense department) over boeing (the choice of the military). at the request of senator henry jackson, senator john mcclellan held days of mostly closed door hearings before the permanent subcommittee on investigations investigating the tfx contract from february to november . during the summer of , kennedy had a secret taping system set up in the white house, most likely to aid his future memoir. it recorded many conversations with kennedy and his cabinet members, including those in relation to the cuban missile crisis . foreign policy main article foreign policy of the john f. kennedy administration foreign trips of john f. kennedy during his presidency president kennedy s foreign policy was dominated by american confrontations with the soviet union, manifested by proxy contests in the early stage of the cold war. in , he anxiously anticipated a summit with soviet premier nikita khrushchev. he started off on the wrong foot by reacting aggressively to a routine khrushchev speech on cold war confrontation in early . the speech was intended for domestic audiences in the soviet union, but kennedy interpreted it as a personal challenge. his mistake helped raise tensions going into the vienna summit of june . on the way to the summit, kennedy stopped in paris to meet charles de gaulle, who advised him to ignore khrushchev s abrasive style. the french president feared the united states presumed influence in europe. nevertheless, de gaulle was quite impressed with the young president and his family. kennedy picked up on this in his speech in paris, saying that he would be remembered as the man who accompanied jackie kennedy to paris. the kekkonens from finland visited the united states and met john f. kennedy in . from left president urho kekkonen, sylvi kekkonen, jacqueline kennedy onassis and john f. kennedy. on june , , the president met with khrushchev in vienna and left the meetings angry and disappointed that he had allowed the premier to bully him, despite the warnings he had received. khrushchev, for his part, was impressed with the president s intelligence, but thought him weak. kennedy did succeed in conveying the bottom line to khrushchev on the most sensitive issue before them, a proposed treaty between moscow and east berlin. he made it clear that any treaty interfering with u.s access rights in west berlin would be regarded as an act of war. shortly after the president returned home, the u.s.s.r. announced its plan to sign a treaty with east berlin, abrogating any third party occupation rights in either sector of the city. depressed and angry, kennedy assumed that his only option was to prepare the country for nuclear war, which he personally thought had a one in five chance of occurring. kennedy with kwame nkrumah, the first head of an independent ghana, march kennedy with the italian prime minister amintore fanfani, at the white house, in in the weeks immediately following the vienna summit, more than , people fled from east berlin to the western sector, reacting to statements from the ussr. kennedy began intensive meetings on the berlin issue, where dean acheson took the lead in recommending a military buildup alongside nato allies. in a july speech, kennedy announced his decision to add $ . billion (equivalent to $ . billion in ) to the defense budget, along with over , additional troops, stating that an attack on west berlin would be taken as an attack on the u.s. the speech received an % approval rating. a month later, both the soviet union and east berlin began blocking any further passage of east berliners into west berlin and erected barbed wire fences across the city, which were quickly upgraded to the berlin wall. kennedy s initial reaction was to ignore this, as long as free access from west to east berlin continued. this course was altered when west berliners had lost confidence in the defense of their position by the united states. kennedy sent vice president johnson, along with a host of military personnel, in convoy through west germany, including soviet armed checkpoints, to demonstrate the continued commitment of the u.s. to west berlin. kennedy gave a speech at saint anselm college on may , , regarding america s conduct in the emerging cold war. the address detailed how the american foreign policy should be conducted towards african nations, noting a hint of support for modern african nationalism by saying, for we, too, founded a new nation on revolt from colonial rule. cuba and the bay of pigs invasion main article bay of pigs invasion the eisenhower administration had created a plan to overthrow fidel castro s regime in cuba. led by the central intelligence agency (cia), with help from the u.s. military, the plan was for an invasion of cuba by a counter revolutionary insurgency composed of u.s. trained, anti castro cuban exiles led by cia paramilitary officers. the intention was to invade cuba and instigate an uprising among the cuban people, hoping to remove castro from power. kennedy approved the final invasion plan on april , . the president and vice president take a leisurely stroll on the white house grounds the bay of pigs invasion began on april , . fifteen hundred u.s. trained cubans, dubbed brigade , landed on the island. no u.s. air support was provided. cia director allen dulles later stated that they thought the president would authorize any action that was needed for success once the troops were on the ground. by april , , the cuban government had captured or killed the invading exiles, and kennedy was forced to negotiate for the release of the , survivors. twenty months later, cuba released the captured exiles in exchange for $ million worth of food and medicine. the incident made castro feel wary of the u.s. and led him to believe that another invasion would take place. biographer richard reeves said that kennedy focused primarily on the political repercussions of the plan rather than military considerations. when it proved unsuccessful, he was convinced that the plan was a setup to make him look bad. he took responsibility for the failure, saying, we got a big kick in the leg and we deserved it. but maybe we ll learn something from it. in late , the white house formed the special group (augmented), headed by robert kennedy and including edward lansdale, secretary robert mcnamara, and others. the group s objective—to overthrow castro via espionage, sabotage, and other covert tactics—was never pursued. cuban missile crisis main article cuban missile crisis

to this article cuban missile crisis on october , , cia u spy planes took photographs of the soviets construction of intermediate range ballistic missile sites in cuba. the photos were shown to kennedy on october ; a consensus was reached that the missiles were offensive in nature and thus posed an immediate nuclear threat. kennedy faced a dilemma if the u.s. attacked the sites, it might lead to nuclear war with the u.s.s.r., but if the u.s. did nothing, it would be faced with the increased threat from close range nuclear weapons. the u.s. would also appear to the world as less committed to the defense of the hemisphere. on a personal level, kennedy needed to show resolve in reaction to khrushchev, especially after the vienna summit. soviet premier nikita khrushchev and kennedy confer in vienna, more than a third of u.s. national security council (nsc) members favored an unannounced air assault on the missile sites, but for some of them this conjured up an image of pearl harbor in reverse . there was also some concern from the international community (asked in confidence), that the assault plan was an overreaction in light of the fact that eisenhower had placed pgm jupiter missiles in italy and turkey in . it also could not be assured that the assault would be % effective. in concurrence with a majority vote of the nsc, kennedy decided on a naval quarantine. on october , he dispatched a message to khrushchev and announced the decision on tv. the u.s. navy would stop and inspect all soviet ships arriving off cuba, beginning october . the organization of american states gave unanimous support to the removal of the missiles. the president exchanged two sets of letters with khrushchev, to no avail. united nations (un) secretary general u thant requested both parties to reverse their decisions and enter a cooling off period. khrushchev agreed, but kennedy didn t. one soviet flagged ship was stopped and boarded. on october , khrushchev agreed to dismantle the missile sites, subject to un inspections. the u.s. publicly promised never to invade cuba and privately agreed to remove its jupiter missiles from italy and turkey, which were by then obsolete and had been supplanted by submarines equipped with ugm polaris missiles. this crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or after. in the end, the humanity of the two men prevailed. the crisis improved the image of american willpower and the president s credibility. kennedy s approval rating increased from % to % immediately thereafter. latin america and communism main article foreign policy of the john f. kennedy administration § latin america kennedy with chilean president jorge alessandri, on an official visit in december believing that those who make peaceful revolution impossible, will make violent revolution inevitable, kennedy sought to contain the perceived threat of communism in latin america by establishing the alliance for progress, which sent aid to some countries and sought greater human rights standards in the region. he worked closely with puerto rican governor luis muñoz marín for the development of the alliance of progress, and began working towards puerto rico s autonomy. the eisenhower administration, through the cia, had begun formulating plans to assassinate castro in cuba and rafael trujillo in the dominican republic. when president kennedy took office, he privately instructed the cia that any plan must include plausible deniability by the u.s. his public position was in opposition. in june , the dominican republic s leader was assassinated; in the days following, undersecretary of state chester bowles led a cautious reaction by the nation. robert kennedy, who saw an opportunity for the u.s.,

supporting a free laos to a neutral laos, indicating privately that vietnam, and not laos, should be deemed america s tripwire for communism s spread in the area. in may, he dispatched lyndon johnson to meet with south vietnamese president ngo dinh diem. johnson assured diem more aid to mold a fighting force that could resist the communists. kennedy announced a change of policy from support to partnership with diem to defeat of communism in south vietnam. during his presidency, kennedy continued policies that provided political, economic, and military support to the south vietnamese government. in late , the viet cong began assuming a predominant presence, initially seizing the provincial capital of phuoc vinh. kennedy increased the number of military advisors and special forces in the area, from , in to , by late , but he was reluctant to order a full scale deployment of troops. a year and three months later on march , , his successor, president lyndon johnson, committed the first combat troops to vietnam and greatly escalated u.s. involvement, with forces reaching , that year and , in . in late , president kennedy sent roger hilsman, then director of the state department s bureau of intelligence and research, to assess the situation in vietnam. there, hilsman met sir robert thompson, head of the british advisory mission to south vietnam, and the strategic hamlet program was formed. it was approved by kennedy and south vietnam president ngo dinh diem. it was implemented in early and involved some forced relocation, village internment, and segregation of rural south vietnamese into new communities where the peasantry would be isolated from communist insurgents. it was hoped that these new communities would provide security for the peasants and strengthen the tie between them and the central government. by november , the program waned and officially ended in . in early , kennedy formally authorized escalated involvement when he signed the national security action memorandum – subversive insurgency (war of liberation) . operation ranch hand , a large scale aerial defoliation effort, began on the roadsides of south vietnam. depending on which assessment kennedy accepted (department of defense or state), there had been zero or modest progress in countering the increase in communist aggression in return for an expanded u.s. involvement. kennedy with future australian prime minister harold holt in the oval office in in april , kennedy assessed the situation in vietnam, saying, we don t have a prayer of staying in vietnam. those people hate us. they are going to throw our asses out of there at any point. but i can t give up that territory to the communists and get the american people to re elect me. on august , just as the new u.s. ambassador henry cabot lodge jr. arrived, diem and his brother ngo dinh nhu ordered south vietnam forces, funded and trained by the cia, to quell buddhist demonstrations. the crackdowns heightened expectations of a coup d état to remove diem with (or perhaps by) his brother, nhu. lodge was instructed to try getting diem and nhu to step down and leave the country. diem would not listen to lodge. cable (deptel ) followed, dated august , declaring that washington would no longer tolerate nhu s actions, and lodge was ordered to pressure diem to remove nhu. lodge concluded that the only option was to get the south vietnamese generals to overthrow diem and nhu. at week s end, orders were sent to saigon and throughout washington to destroy all coup cables . at the same time, the first formal anti vietnam war sentiment was expressed by u.s. clergy from the ministers vietnam committee. a white house meeting in september was indicative of the different ongoing appraisals; the president was given updated assessments after personal inspections on the ground by the departments of defense (general victor krulak) and state (joseph mendenhall). krulak said that the military fight against the communists was progressing and being won, while mendenhall stated that the country was civilly being lost to any u.s. influence. kennedy reacted, asking, did you two gentlemen visit the same country? the president was unaware that both men were at such odds that they had not spoken to each other on the return flight. in october , the president appointed defense secretary mcnamara and general maxwell d. taylor to a vietnamese mission in another effort to synchronize the information and formulation of policy. the objective of the mcnamara taylor mission emphasized the importance of getting to the bottom of the differences in reporting from u.s. representatives in vietnam. in meetings with mcnamara, taylor, and lodge, diem again refused to agree to governing measures, helping to dispel mcnamara s previous optimism about diem. taylor and mcnamara were enlightened by vietnam s vice president, nguyen ngoc tho (choice of many to succeed diem), who in detailed terms obliterated taylor s information that the military was succeeding in the countryside. at kennedy s insistence, the mission report contained a recommended schedule for troop withdrawals , by year s end and complete withdrawal in , something the nsc considered to be a strategic fantasy . in late october, intelligence wires again reported that a coup against the diem government was afoot. the source, vietnamese general duong van minh (also known as big minh ), wanted to know the u.s. position. kennedy instructed lodge to offer covert assistance to the coup, excluding assassination. on november , , south vietnamese generals, led by big minh , overthrew the diem government, arresting and then killing diem and nhu. kennedy was shocked by the deaths. news of the coup led to renewed confidence initially—both in america and in south vietnam—that the war might be won. mcgeorge bundy drafted a national security action memo to present to kennedy upon his return from dallas. it reiterated the resolve to fight communism in vietnam, with increasing military and economic aid and expansion of operations into laos and cambodia. before leaving for dallas, kennedy told michael forrestal that after the first of the year ... he wanted an in depth study of every possible option, including how to get out of there ... to review this whole thing from the bottom to the top. when asked what he thought the president meant, forrestal said, it was devil s advocate stuff. kennedy delivers the commencement speech at american university, june , historians disagree on whether vietnam would have escalated if kennedy not been assassinated and had won re election in . fueling the debate were statements made by secretary of defense mcnamara in the film the fog of war that kennedy was strongly considering pulling the united states out of vietnam after the election. the film also contains a tape recording of lyndon johnson stating that kennedy was planning to withdraw, a position in which johnson disagreed. kennedy had signed national security action memorandum (nsam) , dated october , which ordered the withdrawal of , military personnel by year s end, and the bulk of them out by . such an action would have been a policy reversal, but kennedy was moving in a less hawkish direction since his speech on world peace at american university on june , . at the time of kennedy s death, no final policy decision was made to vietnam. in , theodore sorensen wrote, i would like to believe that kennedy would have found a way to withdraw all american instructors and advisors from vietnam . but ... i do not believe he knew in his last weeks what he was going to do. sorensen added that, in his opinion, vietnam was the only foreign policy problem handed off by jfk to his successor in no better, and possibly worse, shape than it was when he inherited it. u.s. involvement in the region escalated until his successor lyndon johnson directly deployed regular u.s. military forces for fighting the vietnam war. after kennedy s assassination, president johnson signed nsam on november , . it reversed kennedy s decision to withdraw , troops, and reaffirmed the policy of assistance to the south vietnamese. american university speech world peace speech speech from american university by john f. kennedy, june , (duration ) problems playing this file? see media help. wikisource has original text related to this article a strategy of peace on june , , kennedy, at the high point of his rhetorical powers, delivered the commencement address at american university in washington, d.c. also known as a strategy of peace , not only did the president outline a plan to curb nuclear arms, but he also laid out a hopeful, yet realistic route for world peace at a time when the u.s. and soviet union faced the potential for an escalating nuclear arms race. the president wished to discuss a topic on which too often ignorance abounds and the truth is too rarely perceived—yet it is the most important topic on earth world peace ... i speak of peace because of the new face of war ... in an age when a singular nuclear weapon contains ten times the explosive force delivered by all the allied forces in the second world war ... an age when the deadly poisons produced by a nuclear exchange would be carried by wind and air and soil and seed to the far corners of the globe and to generations yet unborn ... i speak of peace, therefore, as the necessary rational end of rational men ... world peace, like community peace, does not require that each man love his neighbor—it requires only that they live together in mutual tolerance ... our problems are man made—therefore they can be solved by man. and man can be as big as he wants. the president also made two announcements— .) that the soviets had expressed a desire to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty, and .) that the u.s had postponed planned atmospheric tests. west berlin speech kennedy delivering his speech in west berlin ich bin ein berliner (i am a berliner) speech play media ich bin ein berliner speech from the rathaus schöneberg by john f. kennedy, june , (duration ) ich bin ein berliner (i am a berliner) speech (audio) audio only version (duration ) wikisource has original text related to this article jfk s ich bin ein berliner speech in , germany was enduring a time of particular vulnerability due to soviet aggression to the east as well as the impending retirement of west german chancellor adenauer. at the same time, french president charles de gaulle was trying to build a franco west german counterweight to the american and soviet spheres of influence. to kennedy s eyes, this franco german cooperation seemed directed against nato s influence in europe. on june , president kennedy gave a public speech in west berlin. he reiterated the american commitment to germany and criticized communism, and was met with an ecstatic response from a massive audience. kennedy used the construction of the berlin wall as an example of the failures of communism freedom has many difficulties, and democracy is not perfect. but we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in, to prevent them from leaving us. the speech is known for its famous phrase ich bin ein berliner ( i am a citizen of berlin ). a million people were on the street for the speech. kennedy remarked to ted sorensen afterwards we ll never have another day like this one, as long as we live. see also tear down this wall! israel in , kennedy stated, israel will endure and flourish. it is the child of hope and the home of the brave. it can neither be broken by adversity nor demoralized by success. it carries the shield of democracy and it honors the sword of freedom. subsequently, as president, kennedy initiated the creation of security ties with israel, and he is credited as the founder of the us israeli military alliance (which would be continued under subsequent presidents). kennedy ended the arms embargo that the eisenhower and truman administrations had enforced on israel. describing the protection of israel as a moral and national commitment, he was the first to introduce the concept of a special relationship (as he described it to golda meir) between the us and israel. kennedy with israeli foreign minister golda meir, december , kennedy extended the first informal security guarantees to israel in and, beginning in , was the first us president to allow the sale to israel of advanced us weaponry (the mim hawk) as well as to provide diplomatic support for israeli policies, which were opposed by arab neighbors; those policies included israel s water project on the jordan river. as result of this newly created security alliance, kennedy also encountered tensions with the israeli government over the production of nuclear materials in dimona, which he believed could instigate a nuclear arms race in the middle east. after the existence of a nuclear plant was initially denied by the israeli government, david ben gurion stated in a speech to the israeli knesset on december , , that the purpose of the nuclear plant at beersheba was for research in problems of arid zones and desert flora and fauna. when ben gurion met with kennedy in new york, he claimed that dimona was being developed to provide nuclear power for desalinization and other peaceful purposes for the time being. in a may letter to ben gurion, kennedy wrote that he was skeptical and stated that american support to israel could be in jeopardy if reliable information on the israeli nuclear program was not forthcoming, ben gurion repeated previous reassurances that dimona was being developed for peaceful purposes. the israeli government resisted american pressure to open its nuclear facilities to international atomic energy agency (iaea) inspections. in , the us and israeli governments had agreed to an annual inspection regime. a science attaché at the embassy in tel aviv concluded that parts of the dimona facility had been shut down temporarily to mislead american scientists when they visited. according to seymour hersh, the israelis set up false control rooms to show the americans. israeli lobbyist abe feinberg stated it was part of my job to tip them off that kennedy was insisting on an inspection . hersh contends that the inspections were conducted in such a way that it guaranteed that the whole procedure would be little more than a whitewash, as the president and his senior advisors had to understand the american inspection team would have to schedule its visits well in advance, and with the full acquiescence of israel. marc trachtenberg argued that a lthough he was well aware of what the israelis were doing, kennedy chose to take this as satisfactory evidence of israeli compliance with america s non proliferation policy. the american who led the inspection team stated that the essential goal of the inspections was to find ways to not reach the point of taking action against israel s nuclear weapons program. rodger davies, the director of the state department s office of near eastern affairs, concluded in march that israel was developing nuclear weapons. he reported that israel s target date for achieving nuclear capability was – . on may , , undersecretary of state nicholas katzenbach told president johnson that dimona was producing enough plutonium to produce two bombs a year. the state department argued that if israel wanted arms, it should accept international supervision of its nuclear program. dimona was never placed under iaea safeguards. attempts to write israeli adherence to the nuclear non proliferation treaty (npt) into contracts for the supply of u.s. weapons continued throughout . iraq main article foreign policy of the john f. kennedy administration § iraq mohammad reza pahlavi, shah of iran, kennedy, and u.s. defense secretary robert mcnamara in the white house cabinet room on april , relations between the united states and iraq became strained following the overthrow of the iraqi monarchy on july , , which resulted in the declaration of a republican government led by brigadier abd al karim qasim. on june , , qasim mobilized troops along the border between iraq and kuwait, declaring the latter nation an indivisible part of iraq and causing a short lived kuwait crisis . the united kingdom—which had just granted kuwait independence on june , and whose economy was heavily dependent on kuwaiti oil—responded on july by dispatching , troops to the country to deter an iraqi invasion. at the same time, kennedy dispatched a u.s. navy task force to bahrain, and the uk (at the urging of the kennedy administration) brought the dispute to united nations security council, where the proposed resolution was vetoed by the soviet union. the situation was resolved in october, when the british troops were withdrawn and replaced by a , strong arab league force. in december , qasim s government passed public law , which restricted the british and american owned iraq petroleum company (ipc) s concessionary holding to those areas in which oil was actually being produced, effectively expropriating . % of the ipc concession. u.s. officials were alarmed by the expropriation as well as the recent soviet veto of an egyptian sponsored un resolution requesting the admittance of kuwait as un member state, which they believed were connected. senior national security council adviser robert komer worried that if the ipc ceased production in response, qasim might grab kuwait (thus achieving a stranglehold on middle eastern oil production) or throw himself into russian arms. komer also made note of widespread rumors that a nationalist coup against qasim could be imminent, and had the potential to get iraq back on a more neutral keel. in april , the state department issued new guidelines on iraq that were intended to increase american influence there. meanwhile, kennedy instructed the cia—under the direction of archibald bulloch roosevelt jr.—to begin making preparations for a military coup against qasim. the anti imperialist and anti communist iraqi ba ath party overthrew and executed qasim in a violent coup on february , . while there have been persistent rumors that the cia orchestrated the coup, declassified documents and the testimony of former cia officers indicate that there was no direct american involvement, although the cia was actively seeking a suitable replacement for qasim within the iraqi military and had been informed of an earlier ba athist coup plot. the kennedy administration was pleased with the outcome and ultimately approved a $ million arms deal for iraq. ireland john f. kennedy visiting the john barry memorial at crescent quay in wexford, ireland president kennedy in motorcade in patrick street, cork, in ireland on june , during his four day visit to his ancestral home of ireland in june , kennedy accepted a grant of armorial bearings from the chief herald of ireland and received honorary degrees from the national university of ireland and trinity college, dublin. he visited the cottage at dunganstown, near new ross, county wexford, where his ancestors had lived before emigrating to america. kennedy also was the first foreign leader to address the houses of the oireachtas (the irish parliament). on december , , the irish department of justice released declassified police documents indicating that security was heightened as kennedy was the subject of three death threats during this visit. nuclear test ban treaty main article partial nuclear test ban treaty troubled by the long term dangers of radioactive contamination and nuclear weapons proliferation, kennedy and khrushchev agreed to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty, originally conceived in adlai stevenson s presidential campaign. in their vienna summit meeting in june , khrushchev and kennedy both reached an informal understanding against nuclear testing, but the soviet union began testing nuclear weapons that september. in response, the united states conducted tests five days later. shortly afterwards, new u.s. satellites began delivering images which made it clear that the soviets were substantially behind the u.s. in the arms race. nevertheless, the greater nuclear strength of the u.s. was of little value as long as the u.s.s.r. perceived itself to be at parity. in july , kennedy sent w. averell harriman to moscow to negotiate a treaty with the soviets. the introductory sessions included khrushchev, who later delegated soviet representation to andrei gromyko. it quickly became clear that a comprehensive test ban would not be implemented, due largely to the reluctance of the soviets to allow inspections that would verify compliance. ultimately, the united states, the united kingdom, and the soviet union were the initial signatories to a limited treaty, which prohibited atomic testing on the ground, in the atmosphere, or underwater, but not underground. the u.s. senate ratified this and kennedy signed it into law in october . france was quick to declare that it was free to continue developing and testing its nuclear defenses. domestic policy president kennedy in fort worth, texas, on friday morning, november , kennedy called his domestic program the new frontier . it ambitiously promised federal funding for education, medical care for the elderly, economic aid to rural regions, and government intervention to halt the recession. he also promised an end to racial discrimination, although his agenda, which included the endorsement of the voter education project (vep) in , produced little progress in areas such as mississippi, where the vep concluded that discrimination was so entrenched . in his state of the union address, he proposed substantial tax reform and a reduction in income tax rates from the current range of – % to a range of – % as well as a reduction in the corporate tax rates from to %. kennedy added that the top rate should be set at % if certain deductions were not eliminated for high income earners. congress did not act until , a year after his death, when the top individual rate was lowered to %, and the top corporate rate was set at %. to the economic club of new york, he spoke in of ... the paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high and revenues too low; and the soundest way to raise revenue in the long term is to lower rates now. congress passed few of kennedy s major programs during his lifetime, but did vote them through in and under his successor johnson. economy kennedy ended a period of tight fiscal policies, loosening monetary policy to keep interest rates down and to encourage growth of the economy. he presided over the first government budget to top the $ billion mark, in , and his first budget in resulted in the nation s first non war, non recession deficit. the economy, which had been through two recessions in three years and was in one when kennedy took office, accelerated notably throughout his administration. despite low inflation and interest rates, the gdp had grown by an average of only . % per annum during the eisenhower administration (scarcely more than population growth at the time), and it had declined by % during eisenhower s last twelve months in office. the economy turned around and prospered during kennedy s years as president. the gdp expanded by an average of . % from early to late , while inflation remained steady at around % and unemployment eased. industrial production rose by % and motor vehicle sales increased by %. this rate of growth in gdp and industry continued until , and has yet to be repeated for such a sustained period of time. attorney general robert kennedy took the position that steel executives had illegally colluded to fix prices. he stated, we re going for broke. ... their expense accounts, where they ve been and what they ve been doing. ... the fbi is to interview them all. ... we can t lose this. the administration s actions influenced u.s. steel to rescind the price increase. the wall street journal wrote that the administration had acted by naked power, by threats, and by agents of the state security police. yale law professor charles reich opined in the new republic that the administration had violated civil liberties by calling a grand jury to indict u.s. steel for collusion so quickly. an editorial in the new york times praised kennedy s actions and said that the steel industry s price increase imperil ed the economic welfare of the country by inviting a tidal wave of inflation. nevertheless, the administration s bureau of budget reported the price increase would have caused a net gain for the gdp as well as a net budget surplus. the stock market, which had steadily declined since kennedy s election in , dropped % shortly after the administration s action on the steel industry took place. federal and military death penalty during his administration, kennedy oversaw the last federal execution prior to furman v. georgia, a case that led to a moratorium on federal executions. victor feguer was sentenced to death by an iowa federal court and was executed on march , . kennedy commuted a death sentence imposed by a military court on seaman jimmie henderson on february , , changing the penalty to life in prison. on march , , kennedy signed into law hr (pl ), which abolished the mandatory death penalty for first degree murder suspects in the district of columbia, the only remaining jurisdiction in the united states with such a penalty. the death penalty has not been applied in the district of columbia since , and has now been abolished. civil rights movement thurgood marshall, appointed to the federal bench by kennedy in may the turbulent end of state sanctioned racial discrimination was one of the most pressing domestic issues of the s. jim crow segregation was the established law in the deep south. the u.s. supreme court had ruled in in brown v. board of education that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. many schools, especially those in southern states, did not obey the supreme court s decision. the court also prohibited segregation at other public facilities (such as buses, restaurants, theaters, courtrooms, bathrooms, and beaches) but it continued nonetheless. kennedy verbally supported racial integration and civil rights; during his presidential campaign, he telephoned coretta scott king, wife of the reverend martin luther king jr., who had been jailed while trying to integrate a department store lunch counter. robert kennedy called georgia governor ernest vandiver and obtained king s release from prison, which drew additional black support to his brother s candidacy. upon taking office in , kennedy postponed promised civil rights legislation he made while campaigning in , recognizing that conservative southern democrats controlled congressional legislation. historian carl m. brauer concluded that passing any civil rights legislation in would have been futile. during his first year in office, kennedy appointed many blacks to office including his may appointment of civil rights attorney thurgood marshall to the federal bench. in his first state of the union address in january , president kennedy said, the denial of constitutional rights to some of our fellow americans on account of race – at the ballot box and elsewhere – disturbs the national conscience, and subjects us to the charge of world opinion that our democracy is not equal to the high promise of our heritage. kennedy believed the grassroots movement for civil rights would anger many southern whites and make it more difficult to pass civil rights laws in congress, including anti poverty legislation, and he distanced himself from it. kennedy was concerned with other issues in the early part of his administration, such as the cold war, bay of pigs fiasco, and the situation in southeast asia. as articulated by his brother robert, the administration s early priority was to keep the president out of this civil rights mess. civil rights movement participants, mainly those on the front line in the south, viewed kennedy as lukewarm, especially concerning the freedom riders, who organized an integrated public transportation effort in the south, and who were repeatedly met with white mob violence, including by law enforcement officers, both federal and state. kennedy assigned federal marshals to protect the freedom riders rather than using federal troops or uncooperative fbi agents. robert kennedy, speaking for the president, urged the freedom riders to get off the buses and leave the matter to peaceful settlement in the courts. kennedy feared sending federal troops would stir up hated memories of reconstruction after the civil war among conservative southern whites. on march , , kennedy signed executive order , which required government contractors to take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin. it established the president s committee on equal employment opportunity. displeased with kennedy s pace addressing the issue of segregation, martin luther king jr. and his associates produced a document in calling on the president to follow in the footsteps of abraham lincoln and use an executive order to deliver a blow for civil rights as a kind of second emancipation proclamation. kennedy did not execute the order. in september , james meredith enrolled at the university of mississippi but was prevented from entering. in response to that, robert kennedy, now u.s. attorney general, sent federal marshals, while president kennedy reluctantly sent , troops after the situation on campus turned out violent. the ole miss riot of left two people dead and a dozen others injured, but meredith did finally enroll for class. kennedy regretted not sending in troops earlier and he began doubting as to whether the evils of reconstruction of the s and s he had been taught or believed in were true. the instigating subculture at the old miss riot, and at many other racially ignited events, was the ku klux klan. on november , , kennedy signed executive order , which prohibited racial discrimination in federally supported housing or related facilities . both the president and the attorney general were concerned about king s ties to suspected communists jack o dell and stanley levison. after the president and his civil rights expert harris wofford pressed king to ask both men to resign from the sclc, king agreed to ask only o dell to resign from the organization and allowed levison, whom he regarded as a trusted advisor, to remain. in early , kennedy related to martin luther king jr. his thoughts on the prospects for civil rights legislation if we get into a long fight over this in congress, it will bottleneck everything else, and we will still get no bill. civil rights clashes were on the rise that year. brother robert and ted sorenson pressed kennedy to take more initiative on the legislative front. kennedy s report to the american people on civil rights, june , on june , , president kennedy intervened when alabama governor george wallace blocked the doorway to the university of alabama to stop two african american students, vivian malone and james hood, from attending. wallace moved aside only after being confronted by deputy attorney general nicholas katzenbach and the alabama u.s. national guard, which had just been federalized by order of the president. that evening kennedy gave his famous report to the american people on civil rights on national television and radio, launching his initiative for civil rights legislation—to provide equal access to public schools and other facilities, and greater protection of voting rights. his proposals became part of the civil rights act of . the day ended with the murder of a naacp leader, medgar evers, in front of his home in mississippi. as the president had predicted, the day after his tv speech, and in reaction to it, house majority leader carl albert called to advise him that his two year signature effort in congress to combat poverty in appalachia (area redevelopment administration) had been defeated, primarily by the votes of southern democrats and republicans. when arthur m. schlesinger jr. complimented kennedy on his remarks, kennedy bitterly replied, yes, and look at what happened to area development the very next day in the house. he then added, but of course, i had to give that speech, and i m glad that i did. on june , the new york times published an editorial which argued that while the president had initially moved too slowly and with little evidence of deep moral commitment in regards to civil rights he now demonstrate d a genuine sense of urgency about eradicating racial discrimination from our national life. earlier, kennedy had signed the executive order creating the presidential commission on the status of women on december , . former first lady eleanor roosevelt led the commission. the commission statistics revealed that women were also experiencing discrimination; its final report, documenting legal and cultural barriers, was issued in october . further, on june , , kennedy signed the equal pay act of , which amended the fair labor standards act and abolished wage disparity based on sex. kennedy meets with leaders of the march on washington in the oval office, august , over a hundred thousand, predominantly african americans gathered in washington for the civil rights march on washington for jobs and freedom on august , . kennedy feared the march would have a negative effect on the prospects for the civil rights bills in congress, and declined an invitation to speak. he turned over some of the details of the government s involvement to the dept. of justice, which channelled hundreds of thousands of dollars to the six sponsors of the march, including the n.a.a.c.p. and martin luther king s southern christian leadership conference (sclc). to ensure a peaceful demonstration, the organizers and the president personally edited speeches which were inflammatory and agreed the march would be held on a wednesday and would be over at pm. thousands of troops were placed on standby. kennedy watched king s speech on tv and was very impressed. the march was considered a triumph of managed protest , and not one arrest relating to the demonstration occurred. afterwards, the march leaders accepted an invitation to the white house to meet with kennedy and photos were taken. kennedy felt that the march was a victory for him as well and bolstered the chances for his civil rights bill. nevertheless, the struggle was far from over. three weeks later, a bomb exploded on sunday, september , at the th street baptist church in birmingham; by the end of the day, four african american children had died in the explosion, and two other children were shot to death in the aftermath. due to this resurgent violence, the civil rights legislation underwent some drastic amendments that critically endangered any prospects for passage of the bill, to the outrage of the president. kennedy called the congressional leaders to the white house and by the following day the original bill, without the additions, had enough votes to get it out of the house committee. gaining republican support, senator everett dirksen promised the legislation would be brought to a vote preventing a senate filibuster. the legislation was enacted by kennedy s successor president lyndon b. johnson, prompted by kennedy s memory, after his assassination in november, enforcing voting rights, public accommodations, employment, education, and the administration of justice. civil liberties in february , fbi director j. edgar hoover, who was suspicious of civil rights leader martin luther king jr. and viewed him as an upstart troublemaker, presented the kennedy administration with allegations that some of king s close confidants and advisers were communists. concerned by these allegations, the fbi deployed agents to monitor king in the following months. robert kennedy and the president also both warned king to discontinue the suspect associations. after the associations continued, robert kennedy issued a written directive authorizing the fbi to wiretap king and other leaders of the southern christian leadership conference, king s civil rights organization, in october . although kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of king s phones on a trial basis, for a month or so , hoover extended the clearance so his men were unshackled to look for evidence in any areas of king s life they deemed worthy. the wiretapping continued through june and was revealed in . immigration during the campaign kennedy proposed an overhaul of american immigration and naturalization laws to ban discrimination based on national origin. he saw this proposal as an extension of his planned civil rights agenda as president. these reforms later became law through the immigration and nationality act of , which dramatically shifted the source of immigration from northern and western european countries towards immigration from latin america and asia. the policy change also shifted the emphasis in the selection of immigrants in favor of family reunification. the late president s brother, senator edward kennedy helped steer the legislation through the senate. native american relations further information kinzua dam § native americans, and seneca nation § kinzua dam construction of the kinzua dam flooded , acres ( , ha) of seneca nation land that they had occupied under the treaty of , and forced seneca to relocate to salamanca, new york. kennedy was asked by the american civil liberties union to intervene and to halt the project, but he declined, citing a critical need for flood control. he expressed concern about the plight of the seneca, and directed government agencies to assist in obtaining more land, damages, and assistance to help mitigate their displacement. space policy further information space race and space policy of the united states jfk inspects mercury capsule, february the apollo program was conceived early in , during the eisenhower administration, as a follow up to project mercury, to be used as a shuttle to an earth orbital space station, flights around the moon, or landing on it. while nasa went ahead with planning for apollo, funding for the program was far from certain, given eisenhower s ambivalent attitude to manned spaceflight. as senator, kennedy had been opposed to the space program and wanted to terminate it. in constructing his presidential administration, kennedy elected to retain eisenhower s last science advisor jerome wiesner as head of the president s science advisory committee. wiesner was strongly opposed to manned space exploration, having issued a report highly critical of project mercury. kennedy was turned down by seventeen candidates for nasa administrator before the post was accepted by james e. webb, an experienced washington insider who served president truman as budget director and undersecretary of state. webb proved to be adept at obtaining the support of congress, the president, and the american people. kennedy also persuaded congress to amend the national aeronautics and space act to allow him to delegate his chairmanship of the national aeronautics and space council to the vice president, both because of the knowledge of the space program johnson gained in the senate working for the creation of nasa, and to help keep the politically savvy johnson occupied. in kennedy s january state of the union address, he had suggested international cooperation in space. khrushchev declined, as the soviets did not wish to reveal the status of their rocketry and space capabilities. early in his presidency, kennedy was poised to dismantle the manned space program, but postponed any decision out of deference to johnson, who had been a strong supporter of the space program in the senate. kennedy s advisors speculated that a moon flight would be prohibitively expensive, and he was considering plans to dismantle the apollo program due to its cost. kennedy proposing a program to congress that will land men on the moon, may . johnson and sam rayburn are seated behind him. however, this quickly changed on april , , when soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin became the first person to fly in space, reinforcing american fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the soviet union. kennedy now became eager for the u.s. to take the lead in the space race, for reasons of national security and prestige. on april , he sent a memo to johnson, asking him to look into the status of america s space program, and into programs that could offer nasa the opportunity to catch up. after consulting with wernher von braun, johnson responded approximately one week later, concluding that we are neither making maximum effort nor achieving results necessary if this country is to reach a position of leadership. his memo concluded that a manned moon landing was far enough in the future that it was likely the united states would achieve it first. kennedy s advisor ted sorensen advised him to support the moon landing, and on may , kennedy announced the goal in a speech titled special message to the congress on urgent national needs ... i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth. no single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish. full text play media kennedy speaks at rice university, september , (duration ) after congress authorized the funding, webb began reorganizing nasa, increasing its staffing level, and building two new centers a launch operations center for the large moon rocket northwest of cape canaveral air force station, and a manned spacecraft center on land donated through rice university in houston, texas. kennedy took the latter occasion as an opportunity to deliver another speech at rice to promote the space effort on september , , in which he said no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space. ... we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard. full text on november , , in a cabinet meeting with nasa administrator webb and other officials, kennedy explained that the moon shot was important for reasons of international prestige, and that the expense was justified. johnson assured him that lessons learned from the space program had military value as well. costs for the apollo program were expected to reach $ billion (equivalent to $ . billion in ). in a september speech before the united nations, kennedy urged cooperation between the soviets and americans in space, specifically recommending that apollo be switched to a joint expedition to the moon . khrushchev again declined, and the soviets did not commit to a manned moon mission until . on july , , almost six years after kennedy s death, apollo landed the first manned spacecraft on the moon. administration, cabinet, and judicial appointments the kennedy cabinetofficenametermpresidentjohn f. kennedy – vice

connallys in the presidential limousine moments before the assassination in dallas president kennedy was assassinated in dallas, texas, at pm central standard time on friday, november , . he was in texas on a political trip to smooth over frictions in the democratic party between liberals ralph yarborough and don yarborough (no relation) and conservative john connally. traveling in a presidential motorcade through downtown dallas, he was shot once in the back, the bullet exiting via his throat, and once in the head. kennedy was taken to parkland hospital for emergency medical treatment, where he was pronounced dead minutes later. he was years old and had been in office for , days. lee harvey oswald, an order filler at the texas school book depository from which the shots were suspected to have been fired, was arrested for the murder of police officer j.d. tippit, and was subsequently charged with kennedy s assassination. he denied shooting anyone, claiming he was a patsy, and was shot by jack ruby on november , before he could be prosecuted. ruby was arrested and convicted for the murder of oswald. ruby successfully appealed his conviction and death sentence but became ill and died of cancer on january , , while the date for his new trial was being set. president johnson quickly issued an executive order to create the warren commission—chaired by chief justice earl warren—to investigate the assassination. the commission concluded that oswald acted alone in killing kennedy and that oswald was not part of any conspiracy. the results of this investigation are disputed by many. the assassination proved to be a pivotal moment in u.s. history because of its impact on the nation, and the ensuing political repercussions. a fox news poll found that % of americans thought there had been a conspiracy to kill president kennedy, while % thought that there had been a cover up. a gallup poll in november showed % believed in a conspiracy, and only % thought that oswald did it alone. in , the u.s. house select committee on assassinations concluded that it believed that kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy. the committee was unable to identify the other gunmen or the extent of the conspiracy. in , historian carl m. brauer concluded that the public s fascination with the assassination may indicate a psychological denial of kennedy s death, a mass wish ... to undo it. funeral main article state funeral of john f. kennedy president kennedy s family leaving his funeral at the u.s. capitol building a requiem mass

at the federal and state level. while a congressman, kennedy embarked on a seven week trip to india, japan, vietnam, and israel in , at which point he became close with his then year old brother bobby, as well as his year old sister pat. because they were several years apart in age, the brothers had previously seen little of each other. this , mile ( , km) trip was the first extended time they had spent together and resulted in their becoming best friends. bobby would eventually play a major role in his brother s career, serving as his brother s attorney general and presidential advisor. bobby would later run for president in before his assassination, while another kennedy brother, ted, ran for president in . kennedy came in third (behind martin luther king jr. and mother

birth. popular image the kennedy brothers attorney general robert f. kennedy, senator ted kennedy, and president john f. kennedy in kennedy and his wife were younger in comparison to the presidents and first ladies who preceded them, and both were popular in the media culture in ways more common to pop singers and movie stars than politicians, influencing fashion trends and becoming the subjects of numerous photo spreads in popular magazines. although eisenhower had allowed presidential press conferences to be filmed for television, kennedy was the first president to ask for them to be broadcast live and made good use of the medium. in the radio television news directors association presented kennedy with its highest honor, the paul white award, in recognition of his open relationship with the media. mrs. kennedy brought new art and furniture to the white house, and directed its restoration. they invited a range of artists, writers and intellectuals to rounds of white house dinners, raising the profile of the arts in america. on the white house lawn, the kennedys established a swimming pool and tree house, while caroline attended a preschool along with other

president, the first lady, their family, and the administration, sold about four million copies. on may , , marilyn monroe sang happy birthday, mr. president at a large party in madison square garden, celebrating kennedy s upcoming forty fifth birthday. camelot era the term camelot came to be used retrospectively as iconic of the kennedy administration, and the charisma of kennedy and his family. the term was first publicly used by his wife in a post assassination life magazine interview with theodore h. white, in which she revealed his affection for the contemporary broadway musical of the same name, particularly the closing lines of the title song don t let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief, shining moment that was known as camelot. there ll be great presidents again ... but there will never be another camelot.— jacqueline kennedy health in robert dallek wrote an extensive history of kennedy s health. dallek was able to consult a collection of kennedy associated papers from the years – , including x rays and prescription records from the files of white house physician dr. janet travell. according to travell s records, during his presidential years kennedy suffered from high fevers; stomach, colon, and prostate issues; abscesses; high cholesterol; and adrenal problems. travell kept a medicine administration record, cataloguing kennedy s medications injected and ingested corticosteroids for his adrenal insufficiency; procaine shots and ultrasound treatments and hot packs for his back; lomotil, metamucil, paregoric, phenobarbital, testosterone, and trasentine to control his diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and weight loss; penicillin and other antibiotics for his urinary tract infections and an abscess; and tuinal to help him sleep. years after kennedy s death, it was revealed that in september , while kennedy was and in his first term in congress, he was diagnosed by sir daniel davis at the london clinic with addison s disease, a rare endocrine disorder. in dr. travell revealed that kennedy also had hypothyroidism. the presence of two endocrine diseases raises the possibility that kennedy had autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type (aps ). kennedy also suffered from chronic and severe back pain, for which he had surgery and was written up in the american medical association s archives of surgery. kennedy s condition may have had diplomatic repercussions, as he appears to have been taking a combination of drugs to treat severe back pain during the vienna summit with soviet premier nikita khrushchev. the combination included hormones, animal organ cells, steroids, vitamins, enzymes, and amphetamines, and possible potential side effects included hyperactivity, hypertension, impaired judgment, nervousness, and mood swings. kennedy at one time was regularly seen by no fewer than three doctors, one of whom, max jacobson, was unknown to the other two, as his mode of treatment was controversial and used for the most severe bouts of back pain. into late , disagreements existed among kennedy s doctors concerning his proper balance of medication and exercise. the president preferred the former, because he was short on time and desired immediate relief. during that time, the president s physician, george burkley, did set up some gym equipment in the white house basement, where kennedy did stretching exercises for his back three times a week. details of these and other medical problems were not publicly disclosed during kennedy s lifetime. the president s primary white house physician, george burkley, realized that treatments by jacobson and travell, including the excessive use of steroids and amphetamines, were medically inappropriate, and took effective action to remove the president from their care. it was later observed that president kennedy s leadership (e.g. the cuban missile crisis and other events during ) improved greatly once the treatments of jacobson had been discontinued and been replaced by a medically appropriate regimen under burkley. dr. ghaemi, who studied kennedy s medical records, concluded there was a correlation; it is not causation; but it may not be coincidence either . personal tragedies main article kennedy curse the newlyweds surrounded by jack s siblings on their wedding day in newport, rhode island in kennedy and his family have experienced a number of personal tragedies. his older brother joseph p. kennedy jr. was killed in action in at age , when his plane exploded over the english channel during a first attack execution of operation aphrodite during world war ii. kennedy s younger sister rose marie rosemary kennedy was born in with intellectual disabilities and underwent a prefrontal lobotomy at age , leaving her incapacitated for the rest of her life, until her death in . his younger sister kathleen agnes kick kennedy died in a plane crash en route to france in . his wife jacqueline kennedy suffered a miscarriage in and a stillbirth in a daughter informally named arabella. a son, patrick bouvier kennedy, died two days after birth in august . affairs, extramarital relationships and friendships attorney general robert f. kennedy, marilyn monroe, president kennedy (back to camera) in kennedy was single in the s when he had affairs with danish journalist inga arvad and actress gene tierney. before and after he assumed the presidency, kennedy reportedly had extramarital affairs with a number of women, including marilyn monroe, gunilla von post, judith campbell, mary pinchot meyer, marlene dietrich, mimi alford, and his wife s press secretary, pamela turnure. the extent of kennedy s relationship with monroe is not fully known, although it has been reported that they spent a weekend together in march while he was staying at bing crosby s house. furthermore, people at the white house switchboard noted that monroe had called kennedy during . j. edgar hoover, the fbi director, received reports about kennedy s indiscretions. kennedy inspired affection and loyalty from the members of his team and his supporters. according to reeves, this included the logistics of kennedy s liaisons ... which required secrecy and devotion rare in the annals of the energetic service demanded by successful politicians. kennedy believed that his friendly relationship with members of the press would help protect him from public revelations about his sex life. though there has never been any proof of homosexual activity between them, kennedy would often, and even when married, share a bedroom with his lifelong and close friend lem billings. historical evaluations and legacy john f. kennedy memorial, near jerusalem, israel the us special forces had a special bond with kennedy. it was president kennedy who was responsible for the rebuilding of the special forces and giving us back our green beret, said forrest lindley, a writer for the us military newspaper stars and stripes who served with special forces in vietnam. a this bond was shown at kennedy s funeral. at the commemoration of the th anniversary of kennedy s death, general michael d. healy, the last commander of special forces in vietnam, spoke at arlington cemetery. later, a wreath in the form of the green beret would be placed on the grave, continuing a tradition that began the day of his funeral when a sergeant in charge of a detail of special forces men guarding the grave placed his beret on the coffin. kennedy was the first of six presidents to have served in the u.s. navy, and one of the enduring legacies of his administration was the creation in of another special forces command, the navy seals, which kennedy enthusiastically supported. the dedication of a new forever stamp to honor what would be president john f. kennedy s th birthday kennedy s civil rights proposals led to the civil rights act of . president lyndon b. johnson, kennedy s successor, took up the mantle and pushed the landmark civil rights act through a bitterly divided congress by invoking the slain president s memory. president johnson then signed the act into law on july , . this civil rights law ended what was known as the solid south and certain provisions were modeled after the civil rights act of , signed into law by president ulysses s. grant. kennedy s continuation of presidents harry s. truman and dwight d. eisenhower s policies of giving economic and military aid to south vietnam left the door open for president johnson s escalation of the conflict. at the time of kennedy s death, no final policy decision had been made as to vietnam, leading historians, cabinet members, and writers to continue to disagree on whether the vietnam conflict would have escalated to the point it did had he survived. his agreement to the nsam action of withdrawing , troops by the end of , and his earlier speech at american university, suggest that he was ready to end the vietnam war. the vietnam war contributed greatly to a decade of national difficulties, amid violent disappointment on the political landscape. kennedy on a u.s. postage stamp, issue of many of kennedy s speeches (especially his inaugural address) are considered iconic; and despite his relatively short term in office, and the lack of major legislative changes coming to fruition during his term, americans regularly vote him as one of the best presidents, in the same league as abraham lincoln, george washington, and franklin d. roosevelt. some excerpts of kennedy s inaugural address are engraved on a plaque at his grave at arlington. in , the times published an audio recreation of the watchmen on the walls of world freedom speech he was scheduled to deliver at the dallas trade mart on november , . he was posthumously awarded the pacem in terris award (latin peace on earth). it was named after a encyclical letter by pope john xxiii that calls upon all people of goodwill to secure peace among all nations. kennedy is the only president to have predeceased both his mother and father. he is also the only president to have predeceased a grandparent. his maternal grandmother, mary josephine josie hannon, died in august , nine months after his assassination. throughout the english speaking world, the given name kennedy has sometimes been used in honor of president kennedy, as well his brother robert. effect of assassination television became the primary source by which people were kept informed of events surrounding john f. kennedy s assassination. in fact, television started to come of age before the assassination. on september , , kennedy helped inaugurate network television s first half hour nightly evening newscast according to an interview with cbs evening news anchor walter cronkite. john f. kennedy presidential library and museum located in boston, massachusetts newspapers were kept as souvenirs rather than sources of updated information. citation needed in this sense his assassination was the first major tv news event of its kind. tv coverage united the nation, interpreting what went on, and creating memories of this space in time. citation needed all three major u.s. television networks suspended their regular schedules and switched to all news coverage from november through november , , being on the air for hours, making it the longest uninterrupted news event on american tv until . the assassination had an effect on many people, not only in the u.s. but around the world. many vividly remember where they were when they first learned the news that kennedy was assassinated, as with the japanese attack on pearl harbor on december , , before it and the september attacks after it. un ambassador adlai stevenson said of the assassination all of us. ... . will bear the grief of his death until the day of ours. many people have also spoken of the shocking news, compounded by the pall of uncertainty about the identity of the assassin(s), the possible instigators, and the causes of the killing, as an end to innocence, and in retrospect it has been coalesced with other changes of the tumultuous decade of the s, especially the vietnam war. ultimately, the death of president kennedy, and the ensuing confusion surrounding the facts of his assassination, are of political and historical importance insofar as they marked a turning point and decline in the faith of the american people in the political establishment—a point made by commentators from gore vidal to arthur m. schlesinger jr. and implied by oliver stone in several of his films, such as his landmark jfk. citation needed memorials and eponyms main article memorials to john f. kennedy john f. kennedy eternal flame memorial john f. kennedy international airport, american

united states armyyears of service – rank lieutenant colonelunit u.s. army air forces robert strange mcnamara (june , – july , ) was an american business executive and the eighth united states secretary of defense, serving from to under presidents john f. kennedy and lyndon b. johnson. he played a major role in escalating the united states involvement in the vietnam war. mcnamara was responsible for the institution of systems analysis in public policy, which developed into the discipline known today as policy analysis. he was born in san francisco, california, graduated from uc berkeley and harvard business school and served in the united states army air forces during world war ii. after the war, henry ford ii hired mcnamara and a group of other army air force veterans to work for ford motor company. these whiz kids helped reform ford with modern planning, organization, and management control systems. after briefly serving as ford s president, mcnamara accepted appointment as secretary of defense. mcnamara became a close adviser to kennedy and advocated the use of a blockade during the cuban missile crisis. kennedy and mcnamara instituted a cold war defense strategy of flexible response, which anticipated the need for military responses short of massive retaliation. mcnamara consolidated intelligence and logistics functions of the pentagon into two centralized agencies the defense intelligence agency and the defense supply agency. during the kennedy administration, mcnamara presided over a build up of us soldiers in south vietnam. after the gulf of tonkin incident, the number of us soldiers in vietnam escalated dramatically. mcnamara and other us policymakers feared that the fall of south vietnam to a communist regime would lead to the fall of other governments in the region. in october , he launched project , , the lowering of army iq standards which allowed , additional men to be inducted despite almost all being incapable of functioning in any high stress situation or dangerous environment. mcnamara grew increasingly skeptical of the efficacy of committing us soldiers to vietnam. in , mcnamara resigned as secretary of defense to become president of the world bank. he remains the longest serving secretary of defense, having remained in office over seven years. he served as president of the world bank until , shifting the focus of the world bank towards poverty reduction. after retiring, he served as a trustee of several organizations, including the california institute of technology and the brookings

manager of a wholesale shoe company, and his mother was clara nell (strange) mcnamara. his father s family was irish and, in about , following the great irish famine, had emigrated to the u.s., first to massachusetts and later to california. he graduated from piedmont high school in piedmont in , where he was president of the rigma lions boys club and earned the rank of eagle scout. mcnamara attended the university of california, berkeley and graduated in with a b.a. in economics with minors in mathematics and philosophy. he was a member of phi gamma delta fraternity, was elected to phi beta kappa his sophomore year, and earned a varsity letter in crew. mcnamara was also a member of the uc berkeley s order of the golden bear which was a fellowship of students and leading faculty members formed to promote leadership within the student body. he then attended harvard business school, where he earned an m.b.a. in . immediately thereafter, mcnamara worked a year for the accounting firm price waterhouse in san francisco. he returned to harvard in august to teach accounting in the business school and became the institution s highest paid and youngest assistant professor at that time. following his involvement there in a program to teach analytical approaches used in business to officers of the united states army air forces, he entered the usaaf as a captain in early , serving most of world war ii with its office of statistical control. one of his major responsibilities was the analysis of u.s. bombers efficiency and effectiveness, especially the b forces commanded by major general curtis lemay in india, china, and the mariana islands. mcnamara established a statistical control unit for the xx bomber command and devised schedules for b s doubling as transports for carrying fuel and cargo over the hump. he left active duty in with the rank of lieutenant colonel and with a legion of merit. ford motor company edit in , tex thornton, a colonel under whom mcnamara had served, put together a group of former officers from the office of statistical control to go into business together. thornton had seen an article in life magazine portraying ford as being in dire need of reform. henry ford ii, himself a world war ii veteran from the navy, hired the entire group of , including mcnamara. the whiz kids , as they came to be known, helped the money losing company reform its chaotic administration through modern planning, organization, and management control systems. the origins of the phrase the whiz kids can be explained as follows. because of their youth, combined with asking lots of questions, ford employees initially and disparagingly, referred to them as the quiz kids . the quiz kids rebranded themselves as the whiz kids . starting as manager of planning and financial analysis, mcnamara advanced rapidly through a series of top level management positions. he was a force behind the ford falcon sedan, introduced in the fall of —a small, simple and inexpensive to produce counter to the large, expensive vehicles prominent in the late s. mcnamara placed a high emphasis on safety the lifeguard options package introduced the seat belt (a novelty at the time) and a dished steering wheel, which helped to prevent the driver from being impaled on the steering column. after the lincoln line s very large , , and models proved unpopular, mcnamara pushed for smaller versions, such as the lincoln continental. on november , , mcnamara became the first president of ford motor company from outside the ford family. secretary of defense edit president john f. kennedy and mcnamara, united states civil defense booklet fallout protection commissioned by mcnamara after his election in , president elect john f. kennedy first offered the post of secretary of defense to robert a. lovett, who had already served in that position in the truman administration; lovett declined but recommended mcnamara. kennedy had read about mcnamara and his career in a time magazine article on december , , and interviewed him six days later on december , with his brother and right hand man robert f. kennedy also being present. mcnamara told kennedy that he didn t know anything about government, to which kennedy replied we can learn our jobs together. i don t know how to be president either . mcnamara had read kennedy s book profiles in courage and asked him if he had really written it himself, with kennedy insisting that he did. kennedy offered mcnamara the chance to be either secretary of defense or secretary of the treasury; mcnamara came back a week later, accepting the post of secretary of defense on the condition of having the right of final approval in all appointments to the department of defense, with kennedy replying it s a deal . according to special counsel ted sorensen, kennedy regarded mcnamara as the star of his team, calling upon him for advice on a wide range of issues beyond national security, including business and economic matters. mcnamara became one of the few members of the kennedy administration to work and socialize with kennedy, and he became so close to attorney general robert f. kennedy that he served as a pallbearer at the younger kennedy s funeral in . initially, the basic policies outlined by president kennedy in a message to congress on march , , guided mcnamara in the reorientation of the defense program. kennedy rejected the concept of first strike attack and emphasized the need for adequate strategic arms and defense to deter nuclear attack on the united states and its allies. u.s. arms, he maintained, must constantly be under civilian command and control, and the nation s defense posture had to be designed to reduce the danger of irrational or unpremeditated general war. the primary mission of u.s. overseas forces, in cooperation with allies, was to prevent the steady erosion of the free world through limited wars . kennedy and mcnamara rejected massive retaliation for a posture of flexible response. the u.s. wanted choices in an emergency other than inglorious retreat or unlimited retaliation , as the president put it. out of a major review of the military challenges confronting the u.s. initiated by mcnamara in came a decision to increase the nation s limited warfare capabilities. these moves were significant because mcnamara was abandoning president dwight d. eisenhower s policy of massive retaliation in favor of a flexible response strategy that relied on increased u.s. capacity to conduct limited, non nuclear warfare. the kennedy administration placed particular emphasis on improving ability to counter communist wars of national liberation , in which the enemy avoided head on military confrontation and resorted to political subversion and guerrilla tactics. as mcnamara said in his annual report, the military tactics are those of the sniper, the ambush, and the raid. the political tactics are terror, extortion, and assassination. in practical terms, this meant training and equipping u.s. military personnel, as well as such allies as south vietnam, for counterinsurgency operations. during the cuban missile crisis in october , mcnamara served as a member of excomm and played a large role in the administration s handling and eventual defusing of the cuban missile crisis. he was a strong proponent of the blockade option over a missile strike and helped persuade the joint chiefs of staff to agree with the blockade option. increased attention to conventional strength complemented these special forces preparations. in this instance he called up reserves and also proceeded to expand the regular armed forces. whereas active duty strength had declined from approximately , , to , , between (the end of the korean war) and , it increased to nearly , , by june , . then the forces leveled off at around , , until the vietnam military buildup began in , reaching a peak of nearly , , by mid , just after mcnamara left office. nuclear strategy –– trial doctrine edit when mcnamara took over the pentagon in , the united states military relied on an all out nuclear strike to respond to a soviet attack of any kind. this kind of strike would lead to the death of soviet military forces and also civilians. this was the same nuclear strategy planned by the strategic air command (sac), led by general curtis lemay. mcnamara did not agree with this kind of action. he sought other options after seeing that this strategy could not guarantee the destruction of all soviet nuclear weapons, leaving the united states vulnerable to retaliation. mcnamara s alternative in the doctrine of counterforce was to try to limit the united states nuclear exchange by targeting only enemy military forces. this concept would be used to prevent retaliation and escalation by holding soviet cities hostage to a follow up strike. mcnamara later concluded that counterforce was not likely to control escalation but likely to provoke retaliation. the u.s. nuclear policy remained the same. other steps edit mcnamara took other steps to increase u.s. deterrence posture and military capabilities. he raised the proportion of strategic air command (sac) strategic bombers on minute ground alert from % to %, thus lessening their vulnerability to missile attack. in december , he established the united states strike command (stricom). authorized to draw forces when needed from the strategic army corps (strac), the tactical air command, and the airlift units of the military air transport service and the military services, strike command had the mission to respond swiftly and with whatever force necessary to threats against the peace in any part of the world, reinforcing unified commands or... carrying out separate contingency operations. mcnamara also increased long range airlift and sealift capabilities and funds for space research and development. after reviewing the separate and often uncoordinated service efforts in intelligence and communications, mcnamara in consolidated these functions in the defense intelligence agency and the defense communications agency (the latter originally established by secretary gates in ), having both report to the secretary of defense through the jcs. the end effect was to remove the intelligence function from the control of the military and to put it under the control of the secretary of defense. in the same year, he set up the defense supply agency to work toward unified supply procurement, distribution, and inventory management under the control of the secretary of defense rather than the uniformed military. mcnamara s institution of systems analysis as a basis for making key decisions on force requirements, weapon systems, and other matters occasioned much debate. two of its main practitioners during the mcnamara era, alain c. enthoven and k. wayne smith, described the concept as follows first, the word systems indicates that every decision should be considered in as broad a context as necessary... the word analysis emphasizes the need to reduce a complex problem to its component parts for better understanding. systems analysis takes a complex problem and sorts out the tangle of significant factors so that each can be studied by the method most appropriate to it. enthoven and smith said they used mainly civilians as systems analysts because they could apply independent points of view to force planning. mcnamara s tendency to take military advice into less account than had previous secretaries and to override military opinions contributed to his unpopularity with service leaders. it was also generally thought that systems analysis, rather than being objective, was tailored by the civilians to support decisions that mcnamara had already made. citation needed the most notable example citation needed of systems analysis was the planning, programming and budgeting system (ppbs) instituted by united states department of defense comptroller charles j. hitch. mcnamara directed hitch to analyze defense requirements systematically and produce a long term, program oriented defense budget. ppbs evolved to become the heart of the mcnamara management program. according to enthoven and smith, the basic ideas of ppbs were the attempt to put defense program issues into a broader context and to search for explicit measures of national need and adequacy ; consideration of military needs and costs together ; explicit consideration of alternatives at the top decision level ; the active use of an analytical staff at the top policymaking levels ; a plan combining both forces and costs which projected into the future the foreseeable implications of current decisions ; and open and explicit analysis, that is, each analysis should be made available to all interested parties, so that they can examine the calculations, data, and assumptions and retrace the steps leading to the conclusions. in practice, the data produced by the analysis was so large and so complex that while it was available to all interested parties, none of them could challenge the conclusions. among the management tools developed to implement ppbs were the five year defense plan (fydp), the draft presidential memorandum (dpm), the readiness, information and control tables, and the development concept paper (dcp). the annual fydp was a series of tables projecting forces for eight years and costs and manpower for five years in mission oriented, rather than individual service, programs. by , the fydp covered ten military areas strategic forces, general purpose forces, intelligence and communications, airlift and sealift, guard and reserve forces, research and development, central supply and maintenance, training and medical services, administration and related activities, and support of other nations. the draft presidential memorandum (dpm)—intended for the white house and usually prepared by the systems analysis office—was a method to study and analyze major defense issues. sixteen dpms appeared between and on such topics as strategic offensive and defensive forces, nato strategy and force structure, military assistance, and tactical air forces. osd sent the dpms to the services and the joint chief of staff (jcs) for comment; in making decisions, mcnamara included in the dpm a statement of alternative approaches, force levels, and other factors. the dpm in its final form became a decision document. the dpm was hated by the jcs and uniformed military in that it cut their ability to communicate directly to the white house. citation needed the dpms were also disliked because the systems analysis process was so heavyweight that it was impossible for any service to effectively challenge its conclusions. citation needed the development concept paper examined performance, schedule, cost estimates, and technical risks to provide a basis for determining whether to begin or continue a research and development program. but in practice, what it proved to be was a cost burden that became a barrier to entry for companies attempting to deal with the military. it aided the trend toward a few large non competitive defense contractors serving the military. rather than serving any useful purpose, the overhead necessary to generate information that was often in practice ignored resulted in increased costs throughout the system. citation needed the readiness, information, and control tables provided data on specific projects, more detailed than in the fydp, such as the tables for the southeast asia deployment plan, which recorded by month and quarter the schedule for deployment, consumption rates, and future projections of u.s. forces in southeast asia. abm edit toward the end of his term mcnamara also opposed an anti ballistic missile (abm) system proposed for installation in the u.s. in defense against soviet missiles, arguing the $ billion in itself is not the problem; the penetrability of the proposed shield is the problem. under pressure to proceed with the abm program after it became clear that the soviets had begun a similar project, mcnamara finally agreed to a light system which he believed could protect against the far smaller number of chinese missiles. however, he never believed it was wise for the united states to move in that direction because of psychological risks of relying too much on nuclear weaponry and that there would be pressure from many directions to build a larger system than would be militarily effective. he always believed that the best defense strategy for the u.s. was a parity of mutually assured destruction with the soviet union. an abm system would be an ineffective weapon as compared to an increase in deployed nuclear missile capacity. cost reductions edit mcnamara s staff stressed systems analysis as an aid in decision making on weapon development and many other budget issues. the secretary believed that the united states could afford any amount needed for national security, but that this ability does not excuse us from applying strict standards of effectiveness and efficiency to the way we spend our defense dollars.... you have to make a judgment on how much is enough. acting on these principles, mcnamara instituted a much publicized cost reduction program, which, he reported, saved $ billion in the five year period beginning in . although he had to withstand a storm of criticism from senators and representatives from affected congressional districts, he closed many military bases and installations that he judged unnecessary for national security. he was equally determined about other cost saving measures. due to the nuclear arms race, the vietnam war buildup and other projects, total obligational authority (toa) increased greatly during the mcnamara years. fiscal year toa increased from $ . billion in (equal to $ billion in ) to $ . ($ ) billion in (before the major vietnam increases) to $ . ($ ) billion in , mcnamara s last year in office (though he left office in february). not until fy did dod s total obligational authority surpass that of fy in constant dollars. citation needed program consolidation edit one major hallmark of mcnamara s cost reductions was the consolidation of programs from different services, most visibly in aircraft acquisition, believing that the redundancy created waste and unnecessary spending. mcnamara directed the air force to adopt the navy s f phantom and a corsair combat aircraft, a consolidation that was quite successful. conversely, his actions in mandating a premature across the board adoption of the untested m rifle proved catastrophic when the weapons began to fail in combat, though later congressional investigations revealed the causes of these failures as negligence and borderline sabotage on behalf of the army ordnance corp s officers. mcnamara tried to extend his success by merging development programs as well, resulting in the tfx dual service f project. it was to combine navy requirements for an fleet air defense (fad) aircraft and air force requirements for a tactical bomber. his experience in the corporate world led him to believe that adopting a single type for different missions and service would save money. he insisted on the general dynamics entry over the dod s preference for boeing because of commonality issues. though heralded as a fighter that could do everything (fast supersonic dash, slow carrier and short airfield landings, tactical strike, and even close air support), in the end it involved too many compromises to succeed at any of them. the navy version was drastically overweight and difficult to land, and eventually canceled after a grumman study showed it was incapable of matching the abilities of the newly revealed soviet mig and mig aircraft. the f would eventually find its niche as a tactical bomber and electronic warfare aircraft with the air force. citation needed however, many analysts believe that even though the tfx project itself was a failure, mcnamara was ahead of his time as the trend in fighter design has continued toward consolidation — the f falcon and f a hornet emerged as multi role fighters, and most modern designs combine many of the roles the tfx would have had. in many ways, the joint strike fighter is seen as a rebirth of the tfx project, in that it purports to satisfy the needs of three american air arms (as well as several foreign customers), fulfilling the roles of strike fighter, carrier launched fighter, v stol, and close air support (and drawing many criticisms similar to those leveled against the tfx). vietnam war edit see also mcnamara taylor mission, cable , and south vietnamese coup mcnamara at a cabinet meeting, during president john f. kennedy s term, while mcnamara was secretary of defense, america s troops in vietnam increased from to , advisers, who were not supposed to engage in combat but rather to train the army of the republic of vietnam. the number of combat advisers in vietnam when kennedy died varies depending upon source. the first military adviser deaths in vietnam occurred in or under the eisenhower administration, which had infiltrated vietnam, through the efforts of stanley sheinbaum, with an unknown number of cia operatives and other special forces in addition to almost advisers. the truman and eisenhower administrations had committed the united states to support the french and native anti communist forces in vietnam in resisting efforts by the communists in the north to unify the country, though neither administration established actual combat forces in the war. the u.s. role—initially limited to financial support, military advice and covert intelligence gathering—expanded after when the french withdrew. during the kennedy administration, the u.s. military advisory group in south vietnam steadily increased, with mcnamara s concurrence, from to , . u.s. involvement escalated after the gulf of tonkin incidents in august , involving two purported attacks on a u.s. navy destroyer by north vietnamese naval vessels. records from the lyndon johnson library have perhaps indicated that mcnamara misled johnson on the attack on a u.s. navy destroyer by allegedly withholding calls against executing airstrikes from us pacific commanders. mcnamara was also instrumental in presenting the event to congress and the public as justification for escalation of the war against the communists. in , mcnamara met with former north vietnam defense minister võ nguyên giáp who told his american counterpart that the august attack never happened, a conclusion mcnamara eventually came to accept. president johnson ordered retaliatory air strikes on north vietnamese naval bases. congress approved, with only senators wayne morse (d or), and ernest gruening (d ak), voting against, the gulf of tonkin resolution, authorizing the president to take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the u.s. and to prevent further aggression. regardless of the particulars of the incident, the larger issue would turn out to be the sweeping powers granted by the resolution. it gave johnson virtually unfettered authority to expand retaliation for a relatively minor naval incident into a major land war involving , american soldiers. the fundamental issue of tonkin gulf involved not deception but, rather, misuse of power bestowed by the resolution, mcnamara wrote later. in , in response to stepped up military activity by the viet cong in south vietnam and their north vietnamese allies, the u.s. began bombing north vietnam, deployed large military forces and entered into combat in south vietnam. mcnamara s plan, supported by requests from top u.s. military commanders in vietnam, led to the commitment of , troops by the end of and almost , by june , . the casualty lists mounted as the number of troops and the intensity of fighting escalated. mcnamara put in place a statistical strategy for victory in vietnam. he concluded that there were a limited number of viet cong fighters in vietnam and that a war of attrition would destroy them. he applied metrics (body counts) to determine how close to success his plan was. citation needed mcnamara with australian prime minister harold holt at the pentagon in july mcnamara commissioned the vietnam study task force on june , . intended as the official record of us military involvement in the indochina peninsula, the final report ran to , pages and was classified as top secret – sensitive . the report was ultimately leaked to the new york times by daniel ellsberg, a former aid to mcnamara s assistant secretary of defense, john mcnaughton. the leak became known as the pentagon papers, revealing that mcnamara and others had been aware that the vietnam offensive was futile. subsequent efforts by the nixon administration to prevent such leaks lead indirectly to the watergate scandal. although he was a prime architect of the vietnam war and repeatedly overruled the jcs on strategic matters, mcnamara gradually became skeptical about whether the war could be won by deploying more troops to south vietnam and intensifying the bombing of north vietnam, a claim he would publish in a book years later. he also stated later that his support of the vietnam war was given out of loyalty to administration policy. he traveled to vietnam many times to study the situation firsthand and became increasingly reluctant to approve the large force increments requested by the military commanders. not specific enough to verify mcnamara said that the domino theory was the main reason for entering the vietnam war. in the same interview he stated, kennedy hadn t said before he died whether, faced with the loss of vietnam, he would completely withdraw; but i believe today that had he faced that choice, he would have withdrawn. social equity edit to commemorate president harry s truman s signing an order to end segregation in the military mcnamara issued directive . on july , . this directive, equal opportunity in the armed forces, dealt directly with the issue of racial and gender discrimination in areas surrounding military communities. the directive declared, every military commander has the responsibility to oppose discriminatory practices affecting his men and their dependents and to foster equal opportunity for them, not only in areas under his immediate control, but also in nearby communities where they may live or gather in off duty hours. (para. ii.c.) under the directive, commanding officers were obligated to use the economic power of the military to influence local businesses in their treatment of minorities and women. with the approval of the secretary of defense, the commanding officer could declare areas off limits to military personnel for discriminatory practices. cuban missile crisis edit the cuban missile crisis was between the united states and the soviet union lasting for days in october . during this time, robert mcnamara was serving as secretary of defense and one of john f. kennedy s trusted advisors. when kennedy received confirmation of the placement of offensive soviet missiles in cuba, he immediately set up executive committee , refereed to as excomm . this committee included united states government officials, including robert mcnamara, to advise kennedy on the crisis. kennedy instructed excomm to immediately come up with a response to the soviet threat unanimously without him present. during this time it was confirmed the crisis had to be resolved within hours by receiving two messages from nikita khruschev. the first message, an informal one, stated if the united states guaranteed to not invade cuba then they would take the missiles out. the second message, a more formal one, was broadcast on the radio stating if the united states attacked then cuba was prepared to retaliate with masses of military power. although american defense planning focused on using nuclear weapons, kennedy and mcnamara saw it was clear the use of strategic weapons could be suicidal. on tuesday october , excomm had their first meeting.the majority of officials favored an air attack on cuba in hopes to destroy the missile sites, although the vote was not unanimous which brought them to other alternatives. by the end of the week, excomm came up with four different alternative strategies to present to the president a blockade, an air strike, an invasion, or some combination of these. these actions are known as oplan , oplan and oplan . a quarantine was a way to prevent the soviets from bringing any military equipment in or out of cuba. during the final review of both alternatives on sunday october , upon kennedy s request, mcnamara presented the argument against the attack and for the quarantine. on wednesday, october at a.m. edt, the quarantine line around cuba went into effect. following cuba s aftermath, mcnamara stated, there is no such thing as strategy, only crisis management. departure edit a cabinet meeting with dean rusk, president johnson and mcnamara mcnamara wrote of his close personal friendship with jackie kennedy and how she demanded that he stop the killing in vietnam. as mcnamara grew more and more controversial after and his differences with the president and the joint chiefs of staff over vietnam strategy became the subject of public speculation, frequent rumors surfaced that he would leave office. in an early november memorandum to johnson, mcnamara s recommendation to freeze troop levels, stop bombing north vietnam and for the u.s. to hand over ground fighting to south vietnam was rejected outright by the president. mcnamara s recommendations amounted to his saying that the strategy of the united states in vietnam which had been pursued to date had failed. mcnamara later stated he never heard back from johnson regarding the memo. largely as a result, on november of that year, mcnamara announced his pending resignation and that he would become president of the world bank. other factors were the increasing intensity of the anti war movement in the u.s., the approaching presidential campaign in which johnson was expected to seek re election, and mcnamara s support—over the objections of the joint chiefs of staff—of construction along the th parallel separating south and north vietnam of a line of fortifications running from the coast of vietnam into laos. the president s announcement of mcnamara s move to the world bank stressed his stated interest in the job and that he deserved a change after seven years as secretary of defense (longer than any of his predecessors or successors). others give a different view of mcnamara s departure from office. for example, stanley karnow in his book vietnam a history strongly suggests that mcnamara was asked to leave by the president. mcnamara himself expressed uncertainty about the question. mcnamara left office on february , ; for his efforts, the president awarded him both the medal of freedom and the distinguished service medal. shortly after mcnamara departed the pentagon, he published the essence of security, discussing various aspects of his tenure and position on basic national security issues. he did not speak out again on defense issues or vietnam until after he left the world bank. world bank president edit robert mcnamara served as head of the world bank from april to june , when he turned . in his years at the bank, he introduced key changes, most notably, shifting the bank s focus toward targeted poverty reduction. he negotiated, with the conflicting countries represented on the board, a growth in funds to channel credits for development, in the form of health, food, and education projects. he also instituted new methods of evaluating the effectiveness of funded projects. one notable project started during mcnamara s tenure was the effort to prevent river blindness. reportedly, mcnamara first heard about his appointment as president of the world bank through a press leak. the world bank currently has a scholarship program under his name. as world bank president, he declared at the annual meeting of the international monetary fund and the world bank group that countries permitting birth control practices would get preferential access to resources. post–world bank activities and assessments edit in , mcnamara joined several other former national security officials in urging that the united states pledge to not use nuclear weapons first in europe in the event of hostilities; subsequently he proposed the elimination of nuclear weapons as an element of nato s defense posture. external video booknotes interview with deborah shapley on promise and power the life and times of robert mcnamara, march , , c span in , washington journalist deborah shapley published a page biography of robert mcnamara titled promise and power the life and times of robert mcnamara. shapley concluded her book with these words for better and worse mcnamara shaped much in today s world – and imprisoned himself. a little known nineteenth century writer, f.w. boreham, offers a summation we make our decisions. and then our decisions turn around and make us. mcnamara s memoir, in retrospect, published in , presented an account and analysis of the vietnam war from his point of view. according to his lengthy new york times obituary, h e concluded well before leaving the pentagon that the war was futile, but he did not share that insight with the public until late in life. in , he took a stand against his own conduct of the war, confessing in a memoir that it was wrong, terribly wrong . in return, he faced a firestorm of scorn at that time. the fog of war eleven lessons from the life of robert s. mcnamara is a errol morris documentary consisting mostly of interviews with robert mcnamara and archival footage. it went on to win the academy award for documentary feature. the particular structure of this personal account is accomplished with the characteristics of an intimate dialog. as mcnamara explains, it is a process of examining the experiences of his long and controversial period as the united states secretary of defense, as well as other periods of his personal and public life. mcnamara maintained his involvement in politics in his later years, delivering statements critical of the bush administration s invasion of iraq. on january , , mcnamara and most living former secretaries of defense and secretaries of state met briefly at the white house with president bush to discuss the war. mcnamara has been portrayed or fictionalized in several films note and in at least one video game. note simon & garfunkel s album, parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme contained a song titled a simple desultory philippic (or how i was robert mcnamara d into submission) . personal life edit mcnamara married margaret craig, his teenage sweetheart, on august , . she was an accomplished cook, and robert s favorite dish was reputed to be her beef bourguignon. margaret mcnamara, a former teacher, used her position as a cabinet spouse to launch a reading program for young children, reading is fundamental, which became the largest literacy program in the country. she died of cancer in . the couple had two daughters and a son. the son robert craig mcnamara, who as a student objected to the vietnam war, is now a walnut and grape farmer in california. he is the owner of sierra orchards in winters, california. daughter kathleen mcnamara spears is a forester with the world bank. the second daughter is margaret elizabeth pastor. in the errol morris documentary, mcnamara reports that both he and his wife were stricken with polio shortly after the end of world war ii. although mcnamara had a relatively short stay in the hospital, his wife s case was more serious and it was concern over meeting her medical bills that led to his decision to not return to harvard but to enter private industry as a consultant at ford motor company. at ford edit when working at ford motor company, mcnamara resided in ann arbor, michigan, rather than the usual auto executive domains of grosse pointe, birmingham, and bloomfield hills. he and his wife sought to remain connected with a university town (the university of michigan) after their hopes of returning to harvard after the war were put on hold. alumnus of the year edit in , he was named alumnus of the year by the university of california, berkeley. attempted assault edit external video booknotes interview with paul hendrickson on the living and the dead robert mcnamara and five lives of a lost war, october , , c span on september , , a passenger on the ferry to martha s vineyard recognized mcnamara on board and attempted to throw him into the ocean. mcnamara declined to press charges. the man remained anonymous but was interviewed years later by author paul hendrickson, who quoted the attacker as saying, i just wanted to confront (mcnamara) on vietnam. widowed edit after his wife s death, mcnamara dated katharine graham, with whom he had been friends since the early s. citation needed graham died in . in september , mcnamara wed diana masieri byfield, an italian born widow who had lived in the united states for more than

glen ora estate in middleburg, virginia, to john f. kennedy during his presidency. at the end of his life mcnamara was a life trustee on the board of trustees of the california institute of technology (caltech), a trustee of the economists for peace and security, a trustee of the american university of nigeria, and an honorary trustee for the brookings institution. mcnamara died in his sleep, at his home in washington, d.c., at a.m. on july , , at the age of . he is buried at the arlington national cemetery in arlington, virginia. mcnamara s papers from his years as secretary of defense are

bomber command and devis schedul for b s doubl as transport for carri fuel and cargo over the hump. he left activ duti in with the rank of lieuten colonel and with a legion of merit. ford motor compani edit in , tex thornton, a colonel under whom mcnamara had served, put togeth a group of former offic from the offic of statist control to go into busi together. thornton had seen an articl in life magazin portray ford as be in dire need of reform. henri ford ii, himself a world war ii veteran from the navy, hire the entir group of , includ mcnamara. the whiz kid , as they came to be known, help the money lose compani reform it chaotic administr through modern planning, organization, and manag control systems. the origin of the phrase the whiz kid can be explain as follows. becaus of their youth, combin with ask lot of questions, ford employe initi and disparagingly, refer to them as the quiz kid . the quiz kid rebrand themselv as the whiz kid . start as manag of plan and financi analysis, mcnamara advanc rapidli through a seri of top level manag positions. he wa a forc behind the ford falcon sedan, introduc in the fall of —a small, simpl and inexpens to produc counter to the large, expens vehicl promin in the late s. mcnamara place a high emphasi on safeti the lifeguard option packag introduc the seat belt (a novelti at the time) and a dish steer wheel, which help to prevent the driver from be impal on the steer column. after the lincoln line s veri larg , , and model prove unpopular, mcnamara push for smaller versions, such as the lincoln continental. on novemb , , mcnamara becam the first presid of ford motor compani from outsid the ford family. secretari of defens edit presid john f. kennedi and mcnamara, unit state civil defens booklet fallout protect commiss by mcnamara after hi elect in , presid elect john f. kennedi first offer the post of secretari of defens to robert a. lovett, who had alreadi serv in that posit in the truman administration; lovett declin but recommend mcnamara. kennedi had read about mcnamara and hi career in a time magazin articl on decemb , , and interview him six day later on decemb , with hi brother and right hand man robert f. kennedi also be present. mcnamara told kennedi that he didn t know anyth about government, to which kennedi repli we can learn our job together. i don t know how to be presid either . mcnamara had read kennedi s book profil in courag and ask him if he had realli written it himself, with kennedi insist that he did. kennedi offer mcnamara the chanc to be either secretari of defens or secretari of the treasury; mcnamara came back a week later, accept the post of secretari of defens on the condit of have the right of final approv in all appoint to the depart of defense, with kennedi repli it s a deal . accord to special counsel ted sorensen, kennedi regard mcnamara as the star of hi team, call upon him for advic on a wide rang of issu beyond nation security, includ busi and econom matters. mcnamara becam one of the few member of the kennedi administr to work and social with kennedy, and he becam so close to attorney gener robert f. kennedi that he serv as a pallbear at the younger kennedi s funer in . initially, the basic polici outlin by presid kennedi in a messag to congress on march , , guid mcnamara in the reorient of the defens program. kennedi reject the concept of first strike attack and emphas the need for adequ strateg arm and defens to deter nuclear attack on the unit state and it allies. u.s. arms, he maintained, must constantli be under civilian command and control, and the nation s defens postur had to be design to reduc the danger of irrat or unpremedit gener war. the primari mission of u.s. oversea forces, in cooper with allies, wa to prevent the steadi eros of the free world through limit war . kennedi and mcnamara reject massiv retali for a postur of flexibl response. the u.s. want choic in an emerg other than inglori retreat or unlimit retali , as the presid put it. out of a major review of the militari challeng confront the u.s. initi by mcnamara in came a decis to increas the nation s limit warfar capabilities. these move were signific becaus mcnamara wa abandon presid dwight d. eisenhow s polici of massiv retali in favor of a flexibl respons strategi that reli on increas u.s. capac to conduct limited, non nuclear warfare. the kennedi administr place particular emphasi on improv abil to counter communist war of nation liber , in which the enemi avoid head on militari confront and resort to polit subvers and guerrilla tactics. as mcnamara said in hi annual report, the militari tactic are those of the sniper, the ambush, and the raid. the polit tactic are terror, extortion, and assassination. in practic terms, thi meant train and equip u.s. militari personnel, as well as such alli as south vietnam, for counterinsurg operations. dure the cuban missil crisi in octob , mcnamara serv as a member of excomm and play a larg role in the administr s handl and eventu defus of the cuban missil crisis. he wa a strong propon of the blockad option over a missil strike and help persuad the joint chief of staff to agre with the blockad option. increas attent to convent strength complement these special forc preparations. in thi instanc he call up reserv and also proceed to expand the regular arm forces. wherea activ duti strength had declin from approxim , , to , , between (the end of the korean war) and , it increas to nearli , , by june , . then the forc level off at around , , until the vietnam militari buildup began in , reach a peak of nearli , , by mid , just after mcnamara left office. nuclear strategi –– trial doctrin edit when mcnamara took over the pentagon in , the unit state militari reli on an all out nuclear strike to respond to a soviet attack of ani kind. thi kind of strike would lead to the death of soviet militari forc and also civilians. thi wa the same nuclear strategi plan by the strateg air command (sac), led by gener curti lemay. mcnamara did not agre with thi kind of action. he sought other option after see that thi strategi could not guarante the destruct of all soviet nuclear weapons, leav the unit state vulner to retaliation. mcnamara s altern in the doctrin of counterforc wa to tri to limit the unit state nuclear exchang by target onli enemi militari forces. thi concept would be use to prevent retali and escal by hold soviet citi hostag to a follow up strike. mcnamara later conclud that counterforc wa not like to control escal but like to provok retaliation. the u.s. nuclear polici remain the same. other step edit mcnamara took other step to increas u.s. deterr postur and militari capabilities. he rais the proport of strateg air command (sac) strateg bomber on minut ground alert from % to %, thu lessen their vulner to missil attack. in decemb , he establish the unit state strike command (stricom). author to draw forc when need from the strateg armi corp (strac), the tactic air command, and the airlift unit of the militari air transport servic and the militari services, strike command had the mission to respond swiftli and with whatev forc necessari to threat against the peac in ani part of the world, reinforc unifi command or... carri out separ conting operations. mcnamara also increas long rang airlift and sealift capabl and fund for space research and development. after review the separ and often uncoordin servic effort in intellig and communications, mcnamara in consolid these function in the defens intellig agenc and the defens commun agenc (the latter origin establish by secretari gate in ), have both report to the secretari of defens through the jcs. the end effect wa to remov the intellig function from the control of the militari and to put it under the control of the secretari of defense. in the same year, he set up the defens suppli agenc to work toward unifi suppli procurement, distribution, and inventori manag under the control of the secretari of defens rather than the uniform military. mcnamara s institut of system analysi as a basi for make key decis on forc requirements, weapon systems, and other matter occas much debate. two of it main practition dure the mcnamara era, alain c. enthoven and k. wayn smith, describ the concept as follow first, the word system indic that everi decis should be consid in as broad a context as necessary... the word analysi emphas the need to reduc a complex problem to it compon part for better understanding. system analysi take a complex problem and sort out the tangl of signific factor so that each can be studi by the method most appropri to it. enthoven and smith said they use mainli civilian as system analyst becaus they could appli independ point of view to forc planning. mcnamara s tendenc to take militari advic into less account than had previou secretari and to overrid militari opinion contribut to hi unpopular with servic leaders. it wa also gener thought that system analysis, rather than be objective, wa tailor by the civilian to support decis that mcnamara had alreadi made. citat need the most notabl exampl citat need of system analysi wa the planning, program and budget system (ppbs) institut by unit state depart of defens comptrol charl j. hitch. mcnamara direct hitch to analyz defens requir systemat and produc a long term, program orient defens budget. ppb evolv to becom the heart of the mcnamara manag program. accord to enthoven and smith, the basic idea of ppb were the attempt to put defens program issu into a broader context and to search for explicit measur of nation need and adequaci ; consider of militari need and cost togeth ; explicit consider of altern at the top decis level ; the activ use of an analyt staff at the top policymak level ; a plan combin both forc and cost which project into the futur the forese implic of current decis ; and open and explicit analysis, that is, each analysi should be made avail to all interest parties, so that they can examin the calculations, data, and assumpt and retrac the step lead to the conclusions. in practice, the data produc by the analysi wa so larg and so complex that while it wa avail to all interest parties, none of them could challeng the conclusions. among the manag tool develop to implement ppb were the five year defens plan (fydp), the draft presidenti memorandum (dpm), the readiness, inform and control tables, and the develop concept paper (dcp). the annual fydp wa a seri of tabl project forc for eight year and cost and manpow for five year in mission oriented, rather than individu service, programs. by , the fydp cover ten militari area strateg forces, gener purpos forces, intellig and communications, airlift and sealift, guard and reserv forces, research and development, central suppli and maintenance, train and medic services, administr and relat activities, and support of other nations. the draft presidenti memorandum (dpm)—intend for the white hous and usual prepar by the system analysi office—wa a method to studi and analyz major defens issues. sixteen dpm appear between and on such topic as strateg offens and defens forces, nato strategi and forc structure, militari assistance, and tactic air forces. osd sent the dpm to the servic and the joint chief of staff (jcs) for comment; in make decisions, mcnamara includ in the dpm a statement of altern approaches, forc levels, and other factors. the dpm in it final form becam a decis document. the dpm wa hate by the jc and uniform militari in that it cut their abil to commun directli to the white house. citat need the dpm were also dislik becaus the system analysi process wa so heavyweight that it wa imposs for ani servic to effect challeng it conclusions. citat need the develop concept paper examin performance, schedule, cost estimates, and technic risk to provid a basi for determin whether to begin or continu a research and develop program. but in practice, what it prove to be wa a cost burden that becam a barrier to entri for compani attempt to deal with the military. it aid the trend toward a few larg non competit defens contractor serv the military. rather than serv ani use purpose, the overhead necessari to gener inform that wa often in practic ignor result in increas cost throughout the system. citat need the readiness, information, and control tabl provid data on specif projects, more detail than in the fydp, such as the tabl for the southeast asia deploy plan, which record by month and quarter the schedul for deployment, consumpt rates, and futur project of u.s. forc in southeast asia. abm edit toward the end of hi term mcnamara also oppos an anti ballist missil (abm) system propos for instal in the u.s. in defens against soviet missiles, argu the $ billion in itself is not the problem; the penetr of the propos shield is the problem. under pressur to proceed with the abm program after it becam clear that the soviet had begun a similar project, mcnamara final agre to a light system which he believ could protect against the far smaller number of chines missiles. however, he never believ it wa wise for the unit state to move in that direct becaus of psycholog risk of reli too much on nuclear weaponri and that there would be pressur from mani direct to build a larger system than would be militarili effective. he alway believ that the best defens strategi for the u.s. wa a pariti of mutual assur destruct with the soviet union. an abm system would be an ineffect weapon as compar to an increas in deploy nuclear missil capacity. cost reduct edit mcnamara s staff stress system analysi as an aid in decis make on weapon develop and mani other budget issues. the secretari believ that the unit state could afford ani amount need for nation security, but that thi abil doe not excus us from appli strict standard of effect and effici to the way we spend our defens dollars.... you have to make a judgment on how much is enough. act on these principles, mcnamara institut a much public cost reduct program, which, he reported, save $ billion in the five year period begin in . although he had to withstand a storm of critic from senat and repres from affect congression districts, he close mani militari base and instal that he judg unnecessari for nation security. he wa equal determin about other cost save measures. due to the nuclear arm race, the vietnam war buildup and other projects, total oblig author (toa) increas greatli dure the mcnamara years. fiscal year toa increas from $ . billion in (equal to $ billion in ) to $ . ($ ) billion in (befor the major vietnam increases) to $ . ($ ) billion in , mcnamara s last year in offic (though he left offic in february). not until fy did dod s total oblig author surpass that of fy in constant dollars. citat need program consolid edit one major hallmark of mcnamara s cost reduct wa the consolid of program from differ services, most visibl in aircraft acquisition, believ that the redund creat wast and unnecessari spending. mcnamara direct the air forc to adopt the navi s f phantom and a corsair combat aircraft, a consolid that wa quit successful. conversely, hi action in mandat a prematur across the board adopt of the untest m rifl prove catastroph when the weapon began to fail in combat, though later congression investig reveal the caus of these failur as neglig and borderlin sabotag on behalf of the armi ordnanc corp s officers. mcnamara tri to extend hi success by merg develop program as well, result in the tfx dual servic f project. it wa to combin navi requir for an fleet air defens (fad) aircraft and air forc requir for a tactic bomber. hi experi in the corpor world led him to believ that adopt a singl type for differ mission and servic would save money. he insist on the gener dynam entri over the dod s prefer for boe becaus of common issues. though herald as a fighter that could do everyth (fast superson dash, slow carrier and short airfield landings, tactic strike, and even close air support), in the end it involv too mani compromis to succeed at ani of them. the navi version wa drastic overweight and difficult to land, and eventu cancel after a grumman studi show it wa incap of match the abil of the newli reveal soviet mig and mig aircraft. the f would eventu find it nich as a tactic bomber and electron warfar aircraft with the air force. citat need however, mani analyst believ that even though the tfx project itself wa a failure, mcnamara wa ahead of hi time as the trend in fighter design ha continu toward consolid — the f falcon and f a hornet emerg as multi role fighters, and most modern design combin mani of the role the tfx would have had. in mani ways, the joint strike fighter is seen as a rebirth of the tfx project, in that it purport to satisfi the need of three american air arm (a well as sever foreign customers), fulfil the role of strike fighter, carrier launch fighter, v stol, and close air support (and draw mani critic similar to those level against the tfx). vietnam war edit see also mcnamara taylor mission, cabl , and south vietnames coup mcnamara at a cabinet meeting, dure presid john f. kennedi s term, while mcnamara wa secretari of defense, america s troop in vietnam increas from to , advisers, who were not suppos to engag in combat but rather to train the armi of the republ of vietnam. the number of combat advis in vietnam when kennedi die vari depend upon source. the first militari advis death in vietnam occur in or under the eisenhow administration, which had infiltr vietnam, through the effort of stanley sheinbaum, with an unknown number

family and childhood edit jacqueline lee bouvier was born on july , , at stony brook southampton hospital in southampton, new york, to wall street stockbroker john vernou black jack bouvier iii and socialite janet norton lee. bouvier s mother was of irish descent, and her father had french, scottish, and english ancestry. a named after her father, bouvier was baptized at the church of st. ignatius loyola in manhattan; she was raised in the catholic faith. her sister lee was born in and died in . bouvier spent her early childhood years in manhattan and at lasata, the bouviers country estate in east hampton on long island. she idolized her father, who likewise favored her over her sister, calling his elder child the most beautiful daughter a man ever had . biographer tina flaherty pointed out jackie s early confidence in herself, seeing a link to her father s praise and positive attitude to her, and her sister lee has stated that she would not have gained her independence and individuality had it not been for the relationship she had with their father and paternal grandfather. from an early age, bouvier was an enthusiastic equestrienne and successfully competed in the sport; horse riding would remain a lifelong passion. she also took ballet lessons, was an avid reader, and excelled at learning languages, with french being particularly emphasized in her upbringing. six year old bouvier in in , bouvier was enrolled in manhattan s chapin school, which she attended for grades – . she was a bright student but often misbehaved; one of her teachers described her as a darling child, the prettiest little girl, very clever, very artistic, and full of the devil . bouvier s mother attributed her daughter s behavior to the way that she finished her assignments ahead of classmates and then acted out in boredom. her behavior improved after the headmistress warned her that none of her positive qualities would matter if she did not behave. the marriage of bouvier s parents was strained by her father s alcoholism and extramarital affairs; the family had also struggled with financial difficulties following the wall street crash of . they separated in and divorced four years later, with the press publishing intimate details of the split. according to her cousin john h. davis, bouvier was deeply affected by the divorce and subsequently had a tendency to withdraw frequently into a private world of her own . when her mother married standard oil heir hugh dudley auchincloss, jr., bouvier and her sister did not attend the ceremony, because it was arranged quickly and travel was restricted due to world war ii. bouvier gained three step siblings from auchincloss two previous marriages, hugh yusha auchincloss iii, thomas gore auchincloss, and nina gore auchincloss; she formed the closest bond with yusha, who became one of her most trusted confidants. the marriage later produced two more children, janet jennings auchincloss in and james lee auchincloss in . after the remarriage, auchincloss merrywood estate in mclean, virginia, became the bouvier sisters primary residence, although they also spent time at his other estate, hammersmith farm in newport, rhode island, and in their father s homes in new york city and long island. although she retained a relationship with her father, bouvier also regarded her stepfather as a close paternal figure. he gave her a stable environment and the pampered childhood she never would have experienced otherwise. while bouvier adjusted to her mother s remarriage, she sometimes felt like an outsider in the wasp social circle of the auchinclosses, attributing the feeling to her being catholic as well as being a child of divorce, which was not common in that social group at that time. after six years at chapin, bouvier attended the holton arms school in northwest washington, d.c. from to , and miss porter s school in farmington, connecticut, from to . she chose miss porter s because it was a boarding school that allowed her to distance herself from the auchinclosses, and because the school placed an emphasis on college preparatory classes. in her senior class yearbook, bouvier was acknowledged for her wit, her accomplishment as a horsewoman, and her unwillingness to become a housewife . jacqueline later hired her childhood friend nancy tuckerman to be her social secretary at the white house. she graduated among the top students of her class and received the maria mckinney memorial award for excellence in literature. college and early career edit in the fall of , bouvier entered vassar college in poughkeepsie, new york. she had wanted to attend sarah lawrence college, closer to new york city, but her parents insisted that she choose the more geographically isolated vassar. bouvier was an accomplished student who participated in the school s art and drama clubs and wrote for its newspaper. due to her dislike for the college, she did not take an active part in its social life and instead traveled back to manhattan on the weekends. she had made her society debut in the summer before entering college and became a frequent presence in new york social functions. hearst columnist igor cassini dubbed her the debutante of the year . bouvier spent her junior year ( – ) in france—at the university of grenoble in grenoble, and at the sorbonne in paris—in a study abroad program through smith college. upon returning home, she transferred to george washington university in washington, d.c., graduating with a bachelor of arts degree in french literature in . during the early years of her marriage to john f. kennedy, she took continuing education classes in american history at georgetown university in washington, d.c. while attending george washington, bouvier won a twelve month junior editorship at vogue magazine; she had been selected over several hundred other women nationwide. the position entailed working for six months in the magazine s new york city office and spending the remaining six months in paris. before beginning the job, bouvier celebrated her college graduation and her sister lee s high school graduation by traveling with her to europe for the summer. the trip was the subject of her only autobiography, one special summer, co authored with lee; it is also the only one of her published works to feature jacqueline s drawings. on her first day at vogue, the managing editor advised her to quit and go back to washington. according to biographer barbara leaming, the editor was concerned about bouvier s marriage prospects; she was years of age and was considered too old to be single in her social circles. bouvier followed the advice, left the job and returned to washington after only one day of work. bouvier moved back to merrywood and was hired as a part time receptionist at the washington times herald. a week later, she approached editor frank waldrop and requested more challenging work; she was given the position of inquiring camera girl , despite waldrop s initial concerns about her competence. the position required her to pose witty questions to individuals chosen at random on the street and take their pictures for publication in the newspaper alongside selected quotations from their responses. in addition to the random man on the street vignettes, she sometimes sought interviews with people of interest, such as six year old tricia nixon. bouvier interviewed tricia a few days after her father richard nixon was elected to the vice presidency in the election. during this time, bouvier was also briefly engaged to a young stockbroker, john g. w. husted, jr. after only a month of dating, the couple published the announcement in the new york times in january . she called off the engagement after three months, because she had found him immature and boring once she got to know him better. marriage to john f. kennedy edit senator john f. kennedy and jacqueline bouvier kennedy on their wedding day, september , bouvier and u.s. representative john f. kennedy belonged to the same social circle and were formally introduced by a mutual friend, journalist charles l. bartlett, at a dinner party in may . bouvier was attracted to kennedy s physical appearance, charm, wit and wealth. the pair also shared the similarities of catholicism, writing, enjoying reading and having previously lived abroad. kennedy was busy running for the u.s. senate in massachusetts; the relationship grew more serious and he proposed to her after the november election. bouvier took some time to accept, because she had been assigned to cover the coronation of queen elizabeth ii in london for the washington times herald. after a month in europe, she returned to the united states and accepted kennedy s marriage proposal. she then resigned from her position at the newspaper. their engagement was officially announced on june , . bouvier and kennedy were married on september , , at st. mary s church in newport, rhode island, in a mass celebrated by boston s archbishop richard cushing. the wedding was considered the social event of the season with an estimated guests at the ceremony and at the reception that followed at hammersmith farm. the wedding dress, now housed in the kennedy library in boston, massachusetts, and the dresses of her attendants were created by designer ann lowe of new york city. jacqueline kennedy standing over her husband, john f. kennedy, after his spinal surgery, december the newlyweds honeymooned in acapulco, mexico, before settling in their new home, hickory hill in mclean, virginia, a suburb of washington, d.c. kennedy developed a warm relationship with her in laws, joseph and rose kennedy. in the early years of their marriage, the couple faced several personal setbacks. john kennedy suffered from addison s disease and from chronic and at times debilitating back pain, which had been exacerbated by a war injury; in late , he underwent a near fatal spinal operation. additionally, jacqueline suffered a miscarriage in and in august gave birth to a stillborn daughter, arabella. they subsequently sold their hickory hill estate to john s brother robert, who occupied it with his wife ethel and their growing family, and bought a townhouse on n street in georgetown. jacqueline gave birth to a daughter caroline on november , . at the time, she and john kennedy were campaigning for his re election to the senate, and they posed with their infant daughter for the cover of the april , issue of life magazine. b which? they traveled together during the campaign, trying to narrow the geographical gap between them that had persisted for the first five years of the marriage. soon enough, john kennedy started to notice the value that his wife added to his congressional campaign. kenneth o donnell remembered that the size of the crowd was twice as big when she accompanied her husband; he also recalled her as always cheerful and obliging . john s mother rose observed jacqueline as not being a natural born campaigner due to her shyness and being uncomfortable with too much attention. in november , john kennedy was reelected to a second term. he credited jacqueline s visibility in both ads and stumping as vital assets in securing his victory, and he called her simply invaluable . in july , historian arthur m. schlesinger visited the kennedy compound in hyannis port and had his first conversation with jacqueline; he found her to have tremendous awareness, an all seeing eye and a ruthless judgment . that year, jack kennedy traveled to states, with jacqueline taking long breaks from the trips so she could spend time with their daughter caroline. she also counseled her husband on improving his wardrobe in preparation for his intended presidential campaign the following year. in particular, she traveled to louisiana to visit edmund reggie and to help her husband garner support in the state for his presidential bid. first lady of the united states ( – ) edit campaign for presidency edit jacqueline with her husband as he campaigns for the presidency in appleton, wisconsin, march on january , , john f. kennedy announced his candidacy for the presidency and launched his campaign nationwide. in the early months of the election year, jacqueline kennedy accompanied her husband to campaign events such as whistle stops and dinners. shortly after the campaign began, she became pregnant and decided to stay at home in georgetown due to her previous high risk pregnancies. kennedy subsequently participated in the campaign by writing a weekly syndicated newspaper column, campaign wife, answering correspondence, and giving interviews to the media. despite not participating on the campaign trail, jacqueline became the subject of intense media attention with her fashion choices. on one hand, she was admired for her personal style; she was frequently featured in women s magazines alongside film stars and named as one of the best dressed women of the world. on the other hand, her preference for french designers and her spending on her wardrobe brought her negative press. in order to downplay her wealthy background, jacqueline stressed the amount of work she was doing for the campaign and declined to publicly discuss her clothing choices. on july at the democratic national convention in los angeles, the democratic party nominated john kennedy for president of the united states. jacqueline did not attend the nomination due to her pregnancy, which had been publicly announced ten days earlier. from hyannis port, she watched the september , debate—which was the nation s first televised presidential debate—between her husband and republican candidate richard nixon, who was the incumbent vice president. marian cannon, the wife of arthur schlesinger, watched the debate with her. days after the debates, jacqueline contacted schlesinger and informed him that john wanted his aid along with that of john kenneth galbraith in preparing for the third debate on october ; she wished for them to give her husband new ideas and speeches. on september , , the kennedys appeared together for a joint interview on person to person, interviewed by charles collingwood. as first lady edit kennedy, president john f. kennedy, andré malraux, marie madeleine lioux malraux, lyndon b. johnson and lady bird johnson prior to a dinner, april . the first lady is wearing a gown designed by oleg cassini on november , , john f. kennedy narrowly defeated republican opponent richard nixon in the u.s. presidential election. a little over two weeks later on november , jacqueline gave birth to the couple s first son, john f. kennedy, jr.. she spent two weeks recovering in the hospital, during which the most minute details of both her and her son s conditions were reported by the media in what has been considered the first instance of national interest in the kennedy family. her husband was sworn in as president on january , . as a presidential couple, the kennedys differed from the eisenhowers by their political affiliation, youth, and their relationship with the media. historian gil troy has noted that in particular, they emphasized vague appearances rather than specific accomplishments or passionate commitments and therefore fit in well in the early s cool, tv oriented culture . the discussion about jacqueline s fashion choices continued during her years in the white house, and she became a trendsetter, hiring american designer oleg cassini to design her wardrobe. she was the first presidential wife to hire a press secretary, pamela turnure, and carefully managed her contact with the media, usually shying away from making public statements, and strictly controlling the extent to which her children were photographed. kennedy was portrayed by the media as the ideal woman, leading academic maurine beasley to observe that she created an unrealistic media expectation for first ladies that would challenge her successors . nevertheless, the first lady attracted worldwide positive public attention and gained allies for the white house and international support for the kennedy administration and its cold war policies. although jacqueline stated that her priority as a first lady was to take care of the president and their children, she also dedicated her time to the promotion of american arts and preservation of its history. the restoration of the white house was her main contribution, but she also furthered the cause by hosting social events that brought together elite figures from politics and the arts. one of her unrealized goals was to found a department of the arts, but she did contribute to the establishment of the national endowment for the arts and the national endowment for the humanities, established during johnson s tenure. white house restoration edit jacqueline had visited the white house on two occasions before she became first lady, the first time as a grade school tourist in and again as the guest of mamie eisenhower shortly before her husband s inauguration. she was dismayed to find that the mansion s rooms were furnished with undistinguished pieces that displayed little historical significance and made it her first major project as first lady to restore its historical character. on her first day in residence, she began her efforts with the help of interior decorator sister parish. she decided to make the family quarters attractive and suitable for family life by adding a kitchen on the family floor and new rooms for her children. the $ , that had been appropriated for this effort was almost immediately exhausted. continuing the project, she established a fine arts committee to oversee and fund the restoration process and solicited the advice of early american furniture expert henry du pont. to solve the funding problem, a white house guidebook was published, sales of which were used for the restoration. working with rachel lambert mellon, kennedy also oversaw the redesign and replanting of the white house rose garden and the east garden, which was renamed the jacqueline kennedy garden after her husband s assassination. in addition, kennedy helped to stop the destruction of historic homes in lafayette square in washington, d.c., because she felt these buildings were an important part of the nation s capital and played an essential role in its history. jacqueline kennedy with charles collingwood during their televised tour of the restored white house in .prior to kennedy s years as first lady, furnishings and other items had been taken from the white house by presidents and their families when they departed; this led to the lack of original historical pieces in the mansion. to track down these missing furnishings and other historical pieces of interest, she personally wrote to possible donors. she also initiated a congressional bill establishing that white house furnishings would be the property of the smithsonian institution, rather than available to departing ex presidents to claim as their own, and founded the white house historical association, the committee for the preservation of the white house, the position of a permanent curator of the white house, the white house endowment trust, and the white house acquisition trust. she was the first presidential spouse to hire a white house curator. on february , , jacqueline took american television viewers on a tour of the white house with charles collingwood of cbs news. in the tour she stated that i feel so strongly that the white house should have as fine a collection of american pictures as possible. it s so important ... the setting in which the presidency is presented to the world, to foreign visitors. the american people should be proud of it. we have such a great civilization. so many foreigners don t realize it. i think this house should be the place we see them best. the film was watched by million television viewers in the united states, and was later distributed to countries. kennedy won a special academy of television arts & sciences trustees award for it at the emmy awards in , which was accepted on her behalf by lady bird johnson. kennedy was the only first lady to win an emmy. foreign trips edit jacqueline kennedy at the taj mahal, agra, uttar pradesh, india, on march , throughout her husband s presidency, kennedy made many official visits to other countries, on her own or with the president—more than any of the preceding first ladies. despite the initial worry that she might not have political appeal , she proved popular among international dignitaries. before the kennedys first official visit to france in , a television special was shot in french with the first lady on the white house lawn. after arriving in the country, she impressed the public with her ability to speak french, as well as her extensive knowledge of french history. at the conclusion of the visit, time magazine seemed delighted with the first lady and noted, there was also that fellow who came with her. even president kennedy joked, i am the man who accompanied jacqueline kennedy to paris – and i have enjoyed it! from france, the kennedys traveled to vienna, austria, where soviet premier nikita khrushchev, when asked to shake the president s hand for a photo, stated, i d like to shake her hand first. khrushchev later sent her a puppy, significant for being the offspring of strelka, the dog that had gone to space during a soviet space mission. at the urging of u.s. ambassador to india john kenneth galbraith, kennedy undertook a tour of india and pakistan with her sister lee radziwill in , which was amply documented in photojournalism of the time as well as in galbraith s journals and memoirs. she was gifted with a horse called sardar by the president of pakistan, ayub khan, as he had found out on his visit to the white house that he and the first lady had a common interest in horses. life magazine correspondent anne chamberlin wrote that kennedy conducted herself magnificently although noting that her crowds were smaller than those that president dwight eisenhower and queen elizabeth ii attracted when they had previously visited these countries. in addition to these well publicized trips during the three years of the kennedy administration, she traveled to countries including afghanistan, austria, canada, colombia, united kingdom, greece, italy, mexico, morocco, turkey, and venezuela. unlike her husband, kennedy was fluent in spanish, which she used to address latin american audiences. death of infant son edit main article patrick bouvier kennedy in early , jacqueline was again pregnant, which led her to curtail her official duties. she spent most of the summer at a home she and the president had rented on squaw island, which was near the kennedy compound on cape cod, massachusetts. on august (five weeks ahead of her scheduled due date), she went into labor and gave birth to a boy, patrick bouvier kennedy, via emergency caesarean section at nearby otis air force base. the infant

there will never be another camelot. —kennedy describing the years of her husband s presidency for life on november , —a week after her husband s assassination—jacqueline was interviewed in hyannis port by theodore h. white of life magazine. in that session, she famously compared the kennedy years in the white house to king arthur s mythical camelot, commenting that the president often played the title song of lerner and loewe s musical recording before retiring to bed. she also quoted queen guinevere from the musical, trying to express how the loss felt. the era of the kennedy administration would subsequently often be referred to as the camelot era, although historians have later argued that the comparison is not appropriate, with robert dallek stating that kennedy s effort to lionize her husband must have provided a therapeutic shield against immobilizing grief. kennedy and her children remained in the white house for two weeks following the assassination. wanting to do something nice for jackie, president johnson offered an ambassadorship to france to her, aware of her heritage and fondness for the country s culture, but she turned the offer down, as well as follow up offers of ambassadorships to mexico and the united kingdom. at her request, johnson renamed the florida space center the john f. kennedy space center a week after the assassination. kennedy later publicly praised johnson for his kindness to her. kennedy spent in mourning and made few public appearances. in the winter following the assassination, she and the children stayed at averell harriman s home in georgetown. on january , , kennedy made a televised appearance from the office of the attorney general, thanking the public for the hundreds of thousands of messages she had received since the assassination and said she had been sustained by america s affection for her late husband. she purchased a house for herself and her children in georgetown but sold it later in and bought a th floor penthouse apartment for $ , at fifth avenue in manhattan in the hopes of having more privacy. kennedy with sisowath kossamak and cambodia s chief of state norodom sihanouk in in the following years, jacqueline attended selected memorial dedications to her late husband. d she also oversaw the establishment of the john f. kennedy presidential library and museum, which is the repository for official papers of the kennedy administration. designed by architect i.m. pei, it is situated next to the university of massachusetts campus in boston. despite having commissioned william manchester s authorized account of president kennedy s death, the death of a president, jacqueline was subject to significant media attention in – when she and robert kennedy tried to block the publication. they sued publishers harper & row in december ; the suit was settled the following year when manchester removed passages that detailed president kennedy s private life. white viewed the ordeal as validation of the measures the kennedy family, jacqueline in particular, were prepared to take to preserve president kennedy s public image. during the vietnam war in november , life magazine dubbed kennedy america s unofficial roving ambassador when she and david ormsby gore, former british ambassador to the united states during the kennedy administration, traveled to cambodia, where they visited the religious complex of angkor wat with chief of state norodom sihanouk. according to historian milton osbourne, her visit was the start of the repair to cambodian us relations, which had been at a very low ebb . she also attended the funeral services of martin luther king, jr. in atlanta, georgia, in april , despite her initial reluctancy due to the crowds and reminders of president kennedy s death. relationship with robert f. kennedy edit after the assassination, jacqueline relied heavily on her brother in law robert f. kennedy; she observed him to be the least like his father of the kennedy brothers. he had been a source of support after she had suffered a miscarriage early in her marriage; it was he, not her husband, who stayed with her in the hospital. in the aftermath of the assassination, bobby became a surrogate father for her children until eventual demands by his own large family and his responsibilities as attorney general required him to reduce attention. he credited jackie with convincing him to stay in politics, and she supported his run for united states senator from new york. the january tet offensive in vietnam resulted in a drop in president johnson s poll numbers, and robert kennedy s advisors urged him to enter the upcoming presidential race. when art buchwald asked him if he intended to run, robert replied, that depends on what jackie wants me to do . which? she met with him around this time and encouraged him to run after she had previously advised him to not follow jack, but to be yourself . privately, she worried about his safety; she believed that bobby was more disliked than her husband had been and that there was so much hatred in the united states. she confided in him about these feelings, but by her own account, he was fatalistic like her. despite her concerns, jacqueline campaigned for her brother in law and supported him, and at one point even showed outright optimism that through his victory, members of the kennedy family would once again occupy the white house. just after midnight pdt on june , , robert kennedy was mortally wounded by gunfire by sirhan sirhan minutes after he and a crowd of his supporters had been celebrating his victory in the california democratic presidential primary. jacqueline kennedy rushed to los angeles from manhattan to join his wife ethel, her brother in law ted kennedy, and the other kennedy family members at his hospital bedside. bobby kennedy never regained consciousness and died hours after the shooting. marriage to aristotle onassis edit after robert kennedy s death, jacqueline reportedly suffered a relapse of the depression she had suffered in the days following her husband s assassination nearly five years prior. she came to fear for her life and those of her children, saying if they re killing kennedys, then my children are targets ... i want to get out of this country . on october , , kennedy married her long time friend aristotle onassis, a wealthy greek shipping magnate who was able to provide the privacy and security she sought for herself and her children. the wedding took place on skorpios, onassis private greek island in the ionian sea. after marrying onassis, she took the legal name jacqueline onassis and consequently lost her right to secret service protection, which is an entitlement of a widow of a u.s. president. the marriage brought her considerable adverse publicity. the fact that aristotle was divorced and his former wife athina livanos was still living led to speculation that jacqueline might be excommunicated by the roman catholic church, though that concern was explicitly dismissed by boston s archbishop, cardinal richard cushing as nonsense . she was condemned by some as a public sinner, and became the target of paparazzi who followed her everywhere and nicknamed her jackie o . during their marriage, the couple inhabited six different residences her room fifth avenue apartment in manhattan, her horse farm in new jersey, his avenue foch apartment in paris, his private island skorpios, his house in athens, and his yacht christina o. kennedy ensured that her children continued a connection with the kennedy family by having ted kennedy visit them often. which? she developed a close relationship with ted, and from then on he was involved in her public appearances. aristotle onassis health deteriorated rapidly following the death of his son alexander in a plane crash in . he died of respiratory failure at age in paris on march , . his financial legacy was severely limited under greek law, which dictated how much a non greek surviving spouse could inherit. after two years of legal wrangling, kennedy eventually accepted a settlement of $ million from christina onassis—aristotle s daughter and sole heir— and waived all other claims to the onassis estate. later years ( – s) edit after the death of her second husband, jacqueline returned permanently to the

protests against a planned skyscraper at columbus circle that would have cast large shadows on central park; the project was cancelled. a later project proceeded despite protests a large twin towered skyscraper, the time warner center, was completed in . onassis remained the subject of considerable press attention, most notoriously involving the paparazzi photographer ron galella, who followed her around and photographed her as she went about her day to day activities; he took candid photos of her without her permission. she ultimately obtained a restraining order against him, and the situation brought attention to the problem of paparazzi photography. from until her death, jacqueline maintained a close relationship with maurice tempelsman, who was her companion and personal financial adviser; he was a belgian born industrialist and diamond merchant who was estranged from his wife. in the early s, onassis supported bill clinton and contributed money to his presidential campaign. following the election, she met with first lady hillary clinton and advised her on raising a child in the white house. in her memoir living history, clinton wrote that onassis was a source of

public which he dubbed immensely appealing . after kennedy s death, kelly barber referred to her as the most intriguing woman in the world , furthering that her stature was also due to her affiliation

family tree notes edit ^ although the french and english ancestors of the bouviers were mostly middle class, her paternal grandfather john vernou bouvier, jr., fabricated a more noble ancestry for the family in his vanity family history book, our forebears, later disproved by the research by her cousin john hagy davis. ^ at first she had opposed the magazine s offer of the cover, not wanting the baby to be used to benefit her husband s political career, but changed her mind in exchange for a promise from her father in law that jack would stop campaigning during the summer to go to paris with her. ^ there were some mixed feelings about whether she should testify, earl warren in particular indicating an unwillingness to interview her while john j. mccloy outright opposed such an inquiry. future president gerald ford, who served on the warren commission, proposed most informally having her interviewed by an associate. with the varying opinions of what to do lingering, warren held a short meeting with kennedy at her apartment. ^ in may , she, robert and ted kennedy joined queen elizabeth ii at runnymede, england, where they dedicated the united kingdom s official memorial to jfk. the memorial included several acres of meadowland given in perpetuity from the uk to the us, near where king john had signed the magna carta in . in , she attended the christening of the u.s. navy aircraft carrier uss john f. kennedy (cv ) in newport news, virginia, a memorial in hyannis port, and a park near new ross, ireland. she also attended a private ceremony in arlington national cemetery that saw the moving of her husband s coffin, after which he was reinterred so that officials at the cemetery could construct a safer and more stable eternal flame and accommodate the tourists extensive foot traffic. ^ prior to her publishing employment, she had gained experience by being involved with several posthumous biographies of president kennedy. the first of these was john f. kennedy, president, by hugh sidey, which was published the year after his death in . simon michael bessie, sidey s editor at atheneum, recalled her as having read galleys and submitted detailed notes on them. despite this recollection, sidey did not acknowledge her contribution in the book. the following year, she helped ted sorensen with his book kennedy. sorensen told greg lawrence that after finishing the first draft of his first big book , he gave onassis the manuscript since he thought she would be helpful, and onassis provided him with several comments on the book. sorensen lauded her assistance in his memoir counselor, as he wrote that she had proved to be a superb editor, correcting typographical errors, challenging mistaken assumptions, defending some of her husband s personnel decisions, suggesting useful clarifications, and repeatedly setting the record straight on matters not known to me . references edit ^ https i.pinimg.com originals b a b a fca c e c .jpg ^ hall, mimi.

luther king jr. and cesar chavez. in , kennedy became a leading candidate for the democratic nomination for the presidency by appealing to poor, african american, hispanic, catholic, and young voters.

sirhan, a year old palestinian, allegedly in retaliation for his support of israel following the six day war. kennedy died the following day. sirhan was arrested, tried, and convicted, though kennedy

kennedy sr. and philanthropist socialite rose fitzgerald kennedy. his older brothers were joseph p. kennedy jr. and john f. jack kennedy, who was elected the th president of the united states in . his younger brother was longtime united states senator edward m. ted kennedy. all four of his grandparents were children of irish immigrants. his father was a wealthy businessman and a leading irish figure in the democratic party. after he stepped down as ambassador to the united kingdom in , joe sr. focused his attention on his oldest son, joseph jr., expecting that he would enter politics and be elected president. he also urged the younger children to examine and discuss current events in order to propel them to public service. after joseph jr. was killed during world war ii, the senior kennedy s hopes fell on his second son, john, to become president. joseph sr. had the money and connections to play a central role in the family s political ambitions. the kennedy family at hyannis port, massachusetts, in with robert on the bottom left in a jacket kennedy s older brother john was often bedridden by illness and, as a result, became a voracious reader. although he made little effort to get to know his younger brother during his childhood, john would take him for walks and regale him with the stories of heroes and adventures he had read. one of their favorite authors was john buchan, who wrote the thirty nine steps, which influenced both robert and john. john sometimes referred to robert as black robert due to his prudishness and disposition. unlike his older brothers, kennedy took to heart their mother rose s agenda for everything to have a purpose, which included visiting historic sites during family outings, visits to the church during morning walks, and games used to expand vocabulary and math skills. he described his position in the family hierarchy by saying, when you come from that far down, you have to struggle to survive. as the boys were growing up, he tried frequently to get his older brothers attention, but was seldom successful. in september , the kennedy family moved to the riverdale neighborhood of new york city, then two years later to suburban bronxville. during his childhood, kennedy spent summers and early autumns with his family at their home (rented in , then purchased in ) in hyannis port, massachusetts, and christmas and easter holidays at their winter retreat in palm beach, florida, later purchased in . he attended riverdale country school—a private school for boys—from kindergarten through second grade. he then attended bronxville public school in lower westchester county from third through fifth grade. he repeated the third grade. a teacher at bronxville reflected that he was a regular boy . she added, it seemed hard for him to finish his work sometimes. but he was only ten after all. he then attended riverdale country school for the sixth grade. kennedy would later recall that during childhood he was going to different schools, always having to make new friends, and that i was very awkward ... a nd i was pretty quiet most of the time. and i didn t mind being alone. he developed an interest in american history. he also decorated his bedroom with pictures of u.s. presidents and filled his bookshelves with volumes on the american civil war. he also became an avid stamp collector and once received a handwritten letter from franklin roosevelt, who was also a philatelist. in march , kennedy sailed to london with his mother and four youngest siblings to join his father who had begun serving as ambassador to the united kingdom. he attended the private gibbs school for boys in london for seventh grade. in april , he gave his first public speech at the placing of a cornerstone for a youth club in england. according to embassy and newspaper reports, his statements were pencilled in his own hand and were delivered in a calm and confident manner. bobby returned to the united states just before the outbreak of world war ii in europe. st. paul s and portsmouth priory in september , kennedy began eighth grade at st. paul s school, an elite protestant private preparatory school for boys in concord, new hampshire, that his father favored. rose kennedy was unhappy with the school s use of the protestant bible. after two months, she took advantage of her ambassador husband s absence from boston and withdrew kennedy from st. paul s. she enrolled him in portsmouth priory school, a benedictine catholic boarding school for boys in portsmouth, rhode island, which held daily morning and evening prayers and mass three times a week, with a high mass on sundays. kennedy attended portsmouth for eighth through tenth grade. at portsmouth priory school, kennedy was known as mrs. kennedy s little boy bobby after he introduced his mother to classmates, who made fun of them. he was defensive of his mother, and on one occasion chased a student out of the dormitory after the boy had commented on her appearance. he befriended peter maclellan and wrote to him, when his brother john was serving in the u.s. navy, that he would be visiting his brother because he might be killed any minute . kennedy blamed himself when his grades failed to improve. in letters to her son, rose urged him to read more and to strengthen his vocabulary. rose also expressed disappointment and wrote that she did not expect him to let her down. he began developing in other ways, and his brother john noticed his increased physical strength, predicting that the younger kennedy would be bouncing me around plenty in two more years . monks at portsmouth priory school regarded him as a moody and indifferent student. father damian kearney, who was two classes behind kennedy, reflected that he didn t look happy and that he did not smile much . according to father damian s review of school records, kennedy was a poor to mediocre student, except for history . milton academy in september , kennedy transferred to his third boarding school, milton academy, in milton, massachusetts, for eleventh and twelfth grades. his father, joseph kennedy sr., wanted kennedy to transfer to milton, believing it would better prepare his son for harvard. at milton, he met and became friends with david hackett. he invited hackett to join him for sunday mass. hackett started accompanying him, and was impressed when kennedy took it upon himself to fill in for a missing altar boy one sunday. hackett admired kennedy s determination to bypass his shortcomings, and remembered him redoubling his efforts whenever something did not come easy to him, which included athletics, studies, success with girls, and popularity. hackett remembered the two of them being misfits , a commonality that drew him to kennedy, along with an unwillingness to conform to how others acted even if doing so meant not being accepted. kennedy s grades improved. one of his first relationships was with a girl named piedy bailey. the pair was photographed together when he walked her home after chapel on a sunday night. bailey was fond of him and remembered him as being very appealing . she recalled him being funny, separate, larky; outside the cliques; private all the time . soon after he transferred to milton, he pressed his father to allow him to enlist, as he wanted to catch up to his brothers who were both serving in the military. kennedy had arrived at milton unfamiliar with his peers and made little attempt to know the names of his classmates; he called most of the other boys fella instead. for this, he was nicknamed fella . most of the school s students had come in eighth or ninth grade and cliques had already been formed. despite this, his schoolmates would later say the school had no prejudice. he had an early sense of virtue; he disliked dirty jokes and bullying, once stepping in when an upperclassman tried bothering a younger student. the headmaster at milton would later summarize that he was a very intelligent boy, quiet and shy, but not outstanding, and he left no special mark on milton . relationship with parents in kennedy s younger years, his father dubbed him the runt of the family and wrote him off. close family friend lem billings once remarked to joe sr. that he was the most generous little boy , and joe sr. replied that he did not know where his son got that . billings commented that the only similarity between robert and joe sr. was their eye color. as kennedy grew, his father worried that he was soft on others, conflicting with his ideology. in response, kennedy developed a tough persona that masked his gentle personality, attempting to appease his father. biographer judie mills wrote that joe sr. s lack of interest in robert was evident by the length of time it took for him to decide to transfer him to milton academy. both joe jr. and john attended the exclusive protestant prep school choate from their freshman year, while robert was already a junior by the time he was enrolled at milton. despite his father s disdain, kennedy continued to seek his approval, requesting that joe sr. write him a letter about his opinions on different political events and world war ii. as a child, kennedy also strove to meet his mother s expectations to become the most dutiful, religious, affectionate, and obedient of the kennedy children, but the father and son grew distant. rose found his gentle personality endearing, though this was noted as having made him invisible to his father . she influenced him heavily and like her, he became a devout catholic and throughout his lifetime he practiced his religion more seriously than the other boys in the family. he impressed his parents as a child by taking on a newspaper route, seeking their approval and wishing to distinguish himself. however, he had the family chauffeur driving him in a rolls royce so that he could make his deliveries. his mother discovered this and the deliveries ceased. joe sr. was satisfied with kennedy as an adult, believing him to have become hard as nails , more like him than any of the other children, while his mother believed he exemplified all she had wanted in a child. mills wrote, his parents conflicting views would be echoed in the opinions of millions of people throughout bobby s life. robert kennedy was a ruthless opportunist who would stop at nothing to attain his ambitions. robert kennedy was america s most compassionate public figure, the only person who could save a divided country. naval service ( – ) kennedy (second from left) during his time at bates college, in front of a snow replica of a navy boat. six weeks before his th birthday in . kennedy enlisted in the united states naval reserve as a seaman apprentice, he was released from active duty in march , when he left milton academy early to report to the v navy college training program at harvard college in cambridge, massachusetts. his v training began at harvard (march–november ) before he was relocated to bates college in lewiston, maine (november –june ). he returned to harvard once again in june completing his post training requirements in january ). at bates he received a specialized v degree along with others and during its winter carnival built a snow replica of a navy boat. while in maine, he wrote a letter to david hackett in which he expressed feelings of inadequacy and frustration at being isolated from the action. he talked of filling his free time by taking classes with other sailors and remarked that things are the same as usual up here, and me being my usual moody self i get very sad at times. he added, if i don t get the hell out of here soon i ll die. aside from hackett, who was serving as a paratrooper, more of his parker hall dorm mates went overseas and left him behind. with others entering combat before him, kennedy said this made him feel more and more like a draft dodger sic or something . he was also frustrated with the apparent desire to shirk military responsibility by some of the other v students. kennedy s brother joseph p. kennedy jr. died in august , when his bomber exploded during a volunteer mission known as operation aphrodite. robert was most affected by his father s reaction to his eldest son s passing. he appeared completely heartbroken and his peer fred garfield commented that kennedy developed depression and questioned his faith for a short time. after his brother s death, kennedy gained more attention, moving higher up the family patriarchy. on december , , the u.s. navy commissioned the destroyer uss joseph p. kennedy, jr., and shortly thereafter granted kennedy s request to be released from naval officer training to serve aboard kennedy starting on february , , as a seaman apprentice on the ship s shakedown cruise in the caribbean. on may , , he received his honorable discharge from the navy. for his service in the navy, kennedy was eligible for the american campaign medal and the world war ii victory medal. further study and journalism ( – ) in september , kennedy entered harvard as a junior, having received credit for his time in the v program. he worked hard to make the varsity football team as an end; he was a starter and scored a touchdown in the first game of his senior year before breaking his leg in practice. he earned his varsity letter when his coach sent him in wearing a cast during the last minutes of a game against yale. his father spoke positively of him when he served as a blocking back and sometime receiver for the faster dave hackett. joseph sr. attended some of kennedy s practices and saw his son catch a touchdown pass in an early season rout of western maryland. his teammates admired his physical courage. he was five feet ten and pounds, which made him too small for college football. despite this, he was a fearless hitter and once tackled a pound fullback head on. wally flynn, another player, looked up in the huddle after one play to see him crying after he broke his leg. he disregarded the injury and kept playing. kennedy earned two varsity letters over the course of the and seasons. throughout , kennedy became active in his brother john s campaign for the u.s. representative seat that was vacated by james curley; he joined the campaign full time after his naval discharge. biographer schlesinger wrote that the election served as an entry into politics for both robert and john. robert graduated from harvard in with a bachelor s degree in political science. after graduating, he sailed immediately on the rms queen mary with a college friend for a six month tour of europe and the middle east, accredited as a correspondent for the boston post, filing six stories. four of these stories, submitted from palestine shortly before the end of the british mandate, provided a first hand view of the tensions in the land. he was critical of british policy on palestine, and praised the jewish people he met there calling them hardy and tough . he held out some hope after seeing arabs and jews working side by side but, in the end, feared that the hatred between the groups was too strong and would lead to a war. in september , he enrolled at the university of virginia school of law in charlottesville. kennedy adapted to this new environment, being elected president of the student legal forum, where he successfully produced outside speakers including james m. landis, william o. douglas, arthur krock, and joseph mccarthy and his family members joe sr. and john f. kennedy. kennedy s paper on yalta, written during his senior year, is deposited in the law library s treasure trove. on june , , kennedy married ethel skakel at st. mary s catholic church in greenwich, connecticut. kennedy graduated from law school in june and flew with ethel to greenwich to stay in his father in law s guest house. the couple s first child, kathleen, was born on july , . during this time, his brother john tried to keep joe sr. at arm s length . the brothers rarely interacted until robert was contacted by kenny o donnell to repair the relationship between john and their father during john s senate campaign. as a result of this, joe sr. came to view kennedy favorably as reliable and willing to sacrifice himself for the family. later that year, kennedy passed the massachusetts bar exam. in september , he went to san francisco as a correspondent for the boston post to cover the convention that concluded the treaty of peace with japan. in october , he embarked on a seven week asian trip with his brother john (then a u.s. congressman from massachusetts th district) and their sister patricia to israel, india, pakistan, vietnam, and japan. because of their age gap, the two brothers had previously seen little of each other—this , mile ( , km) trip came at the behest of their father and was the first extended time they had spent together, serving to deepen their relationship. on this trip, the brothers met liaquat ali khan just prior to his death by assassination, and india s prime minister jawaharlal nehru. senate committee counsel and political campaigns ( – ) jfk senate campaign and joseph mccarthy ( – ) robert, ted, and president john f. kennedy outside the oval office in in november , kennedy moved with his wife and daughter to a townhouse in georgetown in washington, d.c., and started work as a lawyer in the internal security section of the criminal division of the u.s. department of justice; the section was charged with investigating suspected soviet agents. in february , he was transferred to the eastern district of new york in brooklyn to prosecute fraud cases. on june , , kennedy resigned to manage his brother john s successful u.s. senate campaign in massachusetts. jfk s victory was of great importance to the kennedy family, elevating him to national prominence, and turning him into a serious potential presidential candidate. but his brother s victory was equally important to robert, who felt he had succeeded in eliminating his father s negative perceptions of him. in december , at the behest of his father, kennedy was appointed by family friend republican senator joseph mccarthy as assistant counsel of the u.s. senate permanent subcommittee on investigations, however, kennedy disapproved of the senator s aggressive methods of garnering intelligence on suspected communists. this was a highly visible job for him. he resigned in july , but retained a fondness for mccarthy . the period of july to january saw him at a professional and personal nadir , feeling that he was adrift while trying to prove himself to the rest of the kennedy family. after a period as an assistant to his father on the hoover commission, kennedy rejoined the senate committee staff as chief counsel for the democratic minority in february . that month, mccarthy s chief counsel roy cohn subpoenaed annie lee moss, accusing her of membership in the communist party. kennedy revealed that cohn had called the wrong annie lee moss and he requested the file on moss from the fbi. fbi director j. edgar hoover had been forewarned by cohn and denied him access, referring to rfk as an arrogant whipper snapper . when the democrats gained the majority in the senate in january , kennedy became chief counsel and was a background figure in the televised army mccarthy hearings of into mccarthy s conduct. the annie lee moss incident turned cohn into an enemy, which led to kennedy assisting democratic senators in ridiculing cohn during the hearings. the animosity grew to the point where cohn had to be restrained after asking rfk if he wanted to fight him. for his work on the mccarthy committee, kennedy was included in a list of ten outstanding young men of , created by the u.s. junior chamber of commerce. his father had arranged the nomination, his first national award. in , kennedy was admitted to practice before the united states supreme court. stevenson aide and focus on organized labor ( – ) kennedy went on to work as an aide to adlai stevenson during the presidential election which helped him learn how national campaigns worked, in preparation for a future run by his brother, jack. unimpressed with stevenson, he reportedly voted for incumbent dwight d. eisenhower. kennedy was also a delegate at the democratic national convention, having replaced tip o neil at the request of his brother john, joining in what was ultimately an unsuccessful effort to help jfk get the vice presidential nomination. shortly after this, following instructions by his father, kennedy tried making amends with j. edgar hoover. there seemed to be some improvement in their interactions, which came to be seen as elemental political necessity by kennedy. this later changed after kennedy was appointed attorney general, where hoover saw him as an unprecedented threat . from to he made a name for himself while serving as the chief counsel to the senate s mcclellan committee under chairman john l. mcclellan. kennedy was given authority over testimony scheduling, areas of investigation, and witness questioning by mcclellan, a move that was made by the chairman to limit attention to himself and allow outrage by organized labor to be directed toward kennedy. in a famous scene, kennedy squared off with teamsters union president jimmy hoffa during the antagonistic argument that marked hoffa s testimony. during the hearings, kennedy received criticism from liberal critics and other commentators both for his outburst of impassioned anger and doubts about the innocence of those who invoked the fifth amendment. senators barry goldwater and karl mundt wrote to each other and complained about the kennedy boys having hijacked the mcclellan committee by their focus on hoffa and the teamsters. they believed kennedy covered for walter reuther and the united automobile workers, a union which typically would back democratic office seekers. amidst the allegations, kennedy wrote in his journal that the two senators had no guts as they never addressed him directly, only through the press. he left the committee in late in order to run his brother s presidential campaign. jfk presidential campaign ( ) in , kennedy published the successful book, which he had drafted over the summer of the previous year, the enemy within, describing the corrupt practices within the teamsters and other unions that he had helped investigate. biographer evan thomas wrote that the book was a bestseller and could have launched a political career on its own, but family duty called , and kennedy went to work on the presidential campaign of his brother, john. in contrast to his role in his brother s previous campaign eight years prior, kennedy gave stump speeches throughout the primary season, gaining confidence as time went on. his strategy to win at any cost led him to call on franklin d. roosevelt jr. to attack hubert humphrey as a draft dodger; roosevelt eventually did make the statement that humphrey avoided service. concerned that john kennedy was going to receive the democratic party s nomination, some supporters of lyndon johnson, who was also running for the nomination, revealed to the press that jfk had addison s disease, saying that he required life sustaining cortisone treatments. though in fact a diagnosis had been made, kennedy tried to protect his brother by denying the allegation, saying that jfk had never had an ailment described classically as addison s disease . after securing the nomination, john kennedy nonetheless decided to offer lyndon johnson the vice presidency. this did not sit well with some kennedy supporters, and robert tried unsuccessfully to convince johnson to turn down the offer, leading him to view robert with contempt afterward. rfk had already disliked johnson prior to the presidential campaign, seeing him as a threat to his brother s ambitions. rfk wanted his brother to choose labor leader walter reuther. despite kennedy s attempts, johnson became his brother s running mate. kennedy worked toward downplaying his brother s catholic faith during the primary but took a more aggressive and supportive stance during the general election. these concerns were mostly calmed after jfk delivered a speech in september in houston where he said that he was in favor of the separation of church and state. the following month, kennedy was involved in securing the release of civil rights leader martin luther king jr. from a jail in atlanta. kennedy spoke with georgia governor ernest vandiver and later, judge oscar mitchell, after the judge had sentenced king for violating his probation when he protested at a whites only snack bar. attorney general of the united states ( – ) robert kennedy testifying before the senate committee on government operations permanent subcommittee on investigations about organized crime, september after winning the presidential election, president elect john f. kennedy appointed his younger brother attorney general. the choice was controversial, with publications including the new york times and the new republic calling him inexperienced and unqualified. he had no experience in any state or federal court, causing the president to joke, i can t see that it s wrong to give him a little legal experience before he goes out to practice law. however, kennedy was hardly a novice as a lawyer, having gained significant experience conducting investigations and questioning witnesses as a justice department attorney and senate committee counsel and staff director. according to bobby baker, the senate majority secretary and a protégé of lyndon johnson, president elect kennedy did not want to name his brother attorney general. however, their father overruled the president elect. at the behest of johnson, baker persuaded the influential southern senator richard russell to allow a voice vote to confirm the president s brother in january , as kennedy would have been lucky to get votes on a roll call vote. kennedy performed well in his confirmation hearing and chose what friend and biographer arthur m. schlesinger jr. called an outstanding group of deputy and assistant attorneys general, including byron white and nicholas katzenbach. author james w. hilty concludes that kennedy played an unusual combination of roles—campaign director, attorney general, executive overseer, controller of patronage, chief adviser, and brother protector and that nobody before him had had such power. his tenure as attorney general was easily the period of greatest power for the office – no previous united states attorney general had enjoyed such clear influence on all areas of policy during an administration. to a great extent, president kennedy sought the advice and counsel of his younger brother, with robert being the president s closest political adviser. he was relied upon as both the president s primary source of administrative information, and as a general counsel with whom trust was implicit. he exercised widespread authority over every cabinet department, leading the associated press to dub him bobby—washington s no. man . the president once remarked about his brother, if i want something done and done immediately i rely on the attorney general. he is very much the doer in this administration, and has an organizational gift i have rarely if ever seen surpassed. berlin as one of the president s closest white house advisers, kennedy played a crucial role in the events surrounding the berlin crisis of . operating mainly through a private backchannel connection to soviet spy georgi bolshakov, he relayed important diplomatic communications between the american and soviet governments. most significantly, this connection helped the u.s. set up the vienna summit in june , and later to defuse the tank standoff with the soviets at berlin s checkpoint charlie in october. organized crime and the teamsters j. edgar hoover (middle) with john and robert kennedy in as attorney general, kennedy pursued a relentless crusade against organized crime and the mafia, sometimes disagreeing on strategy with fbi director j. edgar hoover. convictions against organized crime figures rose by percent during his term. kennedy worked to shift hoover s focus away from communism, which hoover saw as a more serious threat, to organized crime. according to james neff, kennedy s success in this endeavor was due to his brother s position, giving the attorney general leverage over hoover. biographer richard hack concluded that hoover s dislike for kennedy came from his being unable to control him. he was relentless in his pursuit of teamsters union president jimmy hoffa, due to hoffa s known corruption in financial and electoral matters, both personally and organizationally. the enmity between the two men was intense, with accusations of a personal vendetta – what hoffa called a blood feud – exchanged between them. on july , , after hoffa was reelected to the teamsters presidency, rfk told reporters the government s case against hoffa had not been changed by what he called a small group of teamsters supporting him. the following year, it was leaked that hoffa had claimed to a teamster local that kennedy had been bodily removed from his office, the statement being confirmed by a teamster press agent and hoffa saying kennedy had only been ejected. in hoffa was imprisoned for jury tampering. after learning of hoffa s conviction by telephone, kennedy issued congratulatory messages to the three prosecutors. civil rights kennedy expressed the administration s commitment to civil rights during a speech at the university of georgia law school

as an upstart troublemaker, calling him an enemy of the state . in february hoover presented kennedy with allegations that some of king s close confidants and advisers were communists. concerned about the allegations, the fbi deployed agents to monitor king in the following months. kennedy warned king to discontinue the suspected associations. in response, king agreed to ask suspected communist jack o dell to resign from the sclc, but refused to heed to the request to ask stanley levison, whom he regarded as a trusted advisor, to resign. in october , kennedy issued a written directive authorizing the fbi to wiretap king and other leaders of the southern christian leadership conference, king s civil rights organization. although kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of king s phones on a trial basis, for a month or so , hoover extended the clearance so that his men were unshackled to look for evidence in any areas of king s life they deemed worthy. the wiretapping continued through june and was revealed in , days before kennedy s death. kennedy remained committed to civil rights enforcement to such a degree that he commented in that it seemed to envelop almost every area of his public and private life, from prosecuting corrupt southern electoral officials to answering late night calls from coretta scott king concerning the imprisonment of her husband for demonstrations in alabama. during his tenure as attorney general, he undertook the most energetic and persistent desegregation of the administration that capitol hill had ever experienced. he demanded that every area of government begin recruiting realistic levels of black and other ethnic workers, going so far as to criticize vice president johnson for his failure to desegregate his own office staff. however, relations between the kennedys and civil rights activists could be tense, partly due to the administration s decision that a number of complaints which king filed with the justice department between and be handled through negotiation between the city commission and negro citizens. although it has become commonplace to assert the phrase the kennedy administration or even president kennedy when discussing the legislative and executive support of the civil rights movement, between and a great many of the initiatives that occurred during his tenure were the result of the passion and determination of an emboldened robert kennedy, who, through his rapid education in the realities of southern racism, underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as attorney general. asked in an interview in may , what do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it crime or internal security? kennedy replied, civil rights. the president came to share his brother s sense of urgency on the matters at hand to such an extent that it was at the attorney general s insistence that he made his famous june address to the nation on civil rights. martin luther king jr. and robert kennedy in washington, d.c. on june , kennedy played a large role in the response to the freedom riders protests. he acted after the anniston bus bombings to protect the riders in continuing their journey, sending john seigenthaler, his administrative assistant, to alabama to attempt to secure the riders safety there. despite a work rule which allowed a driver to decline an assignment which he regarded as a potentially unsafe one, he persuaded a manager of the greyhound corporation to obtain a coach operator who was willing to drive a special bus for the continuance of the freedom ride from birmingham, alabama, to montgomery, alabama, on the circuitous journey to jackson, mississippi. later, during the attack and burning by a white mob of the first baptist church in montgomery, at which martin luther king jr. and some , sympathizers were in attendance, the attorney general telephoned king to ask for his assurance that they would not leave the building until the force of u.s. marshals and national guard he sent had secured the area. king proceeded to berate kennedy for allowing the situation to continue . king later publicly thanked him for dispatching the forces to break up the attack that might otherwise have ended his life. kennedy then negotiated the safe passage of the freedom riders from the first baptist church to jackson, mississippi, where they were arrested. he offered to bail the freedom riders out of jail, but they refused, which upset him, leading him to call any bandwagoners of the original freedom rides honkers . citation needed kennedy s attempts to end the freedom rides early were tied to an upcoming summit with nikita khrushchev and charles de gaulle. he believed the continued international publicity of race riots would tarnish the president heading into international negotiations. this attempt to curtail the freedom rides alienated many of the civil rights leaders who, at the time, perceived him as intolerant and narrow minded. in an attempt to better understand and improve race relations, kennedy held a private meeting in new york city in may with a black delegation coordinated by prominent author james baldwin. in september , kennedy sent u.s. marshals to oxford, mississippi, to enforce a federal court order allowing the admittance of the first african american student, james meredith, to the university of mississippi. the attorney general had hoped that legal means, along with the escort of u.s. marshals, would be enough to force governor ross barnett to allow meredith s admission. he also was very concerned there might be a mini civil war between u.s. army troops and armed protesters. president kennedy reluctantly sent federal troops after the situation on campus turned violent. ensuing riots during the period of meredith s admittance resulted in hundreds of injuries and two deaths, yet kennedy remained adamant that black students had the right to enjoy the benefits of all levels of the educational system. the office of civil rights also hired its first african american lawyer when? and began to work cautiously with leaders of the civil rights movement. citation needed kennedy saw voting as the key to racial justice and collaborated with presidents kennedy and johnson to create the landmark civil rights act of , which helped bring an end to jim crow laws. between december and december , kennedy also expanded the united states department of justice civil rights division by percent. u.s. steel at the direction of the president, kennedy also used the power of federal agencies to influence u.s. steel not to institute a price increase. the wall street journal wrote that the administration had set prices of steel by naked power, by threats, by agents of the state security police. yale law professor charles reich wrote in the new republic that the justice department had violated civil liberties by calling a federal grand jury to indict u.s. steel so quickly, then disbanding it after the price increase did not occur. death penalty issues during the kennedy administration, the federal government carried out its last pre furman federal execution (of victor feguer in iowa, ), and kennedy, as attorney general, represented the government in this case. in , kennedy expressed his strong willingness to support a bill then under consideration for the abolition of the death penalty. cuba as his brother s confidant, kennedy oversaw the cia s anti castro activities after the failed bay of pigs invasion. he also helped develop the strategy during the cuban missile crisis to blockade cuba instead of initiating a military strike that might have led to nuclear war. he had initially been among the more hawkish members of the administration on matters concerning cuban insurrectionist aid. his initial strong support for covert actions in cuba soon changed to a position of removal from further involvement once he became aware of the cia s tendency to draw out initiatives, and provide itself with almost unchecked authority in matters of foreign covert operations. citation needed president kennedy with his brother robert, allegations that the kennedys knew of plans by the cia to kill fidel castro, or approved of such plans, have been debated by historians over the years. jfk s friend and associate, historian arthur m. schlesinger jr., for example, expressed the opinion that operatives linked to the cia were among the most reckless individuals to have operated during the period—providing themselves with unscrutinized freedoms to threaten the lives of castro and other members of the cuban revolutionary government regardless of the legislative apparatus in washington—freedoms that, unbeknownst to those at the white house attempting to prevent a nuclear war, placed the entire u.s.–soviet relationship in perilous danger. citation needed the family jewels documents, declassified by the cia in , suggest that before the bay of pigs invasion, the attorney general personally authorized one such assassination attempt. however, ample evidence exists to the contrary, specifically that kennedy was only informed of an earlier plot involving the cia s use of mafia bosses santo trafficante jr. and john roselli during a briefing on may , , and in fact directed the cia to halt any existing efforts directed at castro s assassination. concurrently, kennedy served as the president s personal representative in operation mongoose, the post bay of pigs covert operations program established in november by the president. mongoose was meant to incite a revolution within cuba that would result in the downfall of castro, not castro s assassination. during the cuban missile crisis, kennedy proved himself to be a gifted politician with an ability to obtain compromises, tempering aggressive positions of key figures in the hawk camp. the trust the president placed in him on matters of negotiation was such that his role in the crisis is today seen as having been of vital importance in securing a blockade, which averted a full military engagement between the united states and soviet russia. his clandestine meetings with members of the soviet government continued to provide a key link to nikita khrushchev during even the darkest moments of the crisis, in which the threat of nuclear strikes was considered a very present reality. on the last night of the crisis, president kennedy was so grateful for his brother s work in averting nuclear war that he summed it up by saying, thank god for bobby. assassination of president john f. kennedy robert kennedy at the funeral of his brother, president john f. kennedy, november , at the time that president kennedy was assassinated in dallas on november , , rfk was at home with aides from the justice department. j. edgar hoover called and told him his brother had been shot; before he could ask any questions, hoover hung up. kennedy later said he thought hoover had enjoyed telling him the news. kennedy then received a call from tazewell shepard, a naval aide to the president, who told him that his brother was dead. shortly after the call from hoover, kennedy phoned mcgeorge bundy at the white house, instructing him to change the locks on the president s files. he ordered the secret service to dismantle the oval office and cabinet room s secret taping systems. he scheduled a meeting with cia director john mccone and asked if the cia had any involvement in his brother s death. mccone denied it, with kennedy later telling investigator walter sheridan that he asked the director in a way that he couldn t lie to me, and they the cia hadn t . an hour after the president was shot, bobby kennedy received a phone call from vice president johnson before johnson boarded air force one. rfk remembered their conversation starting with johnson demonstrating sympathy before the vice president stated his belief that he should be sworn in immediately; rfk opposed the idea since he felt it would be nice for president kennedy s body to return to washington with the deceased president still being the incumbent. eventually, the two concluded that the best course of action would be for johnson to take the oath of office before returning to washington. in his book we band of brothers, aide edwin o. guthman recounted kennedy admitting to him an hour after receiving word of his brother s death that he thought he would be the one they would get as opposed to his brother. in the days following the assassination, he wrote letters to his two eldest children, kathleen and joseph, saying that as the oldest kennedy family members of their generation, they had a special responsibility to remember what their uncle had started and to love and serve their country. he was originally opposed to jacqueline kennedy s decision to have a closed casket, as he wanted the funeral to keep with tradition, but he changed his mind after seeing the cosmetic, waxen remains. kennedy was asked by democratic party leaders to introduce a film about his late brother at the party convention. when he was introduced, the crowd, including party bosses, elected officials, and delegates, applauded thunderously and tearfully for a full minutes before they would let him speak. he was close to breaking down before he spoke about his brother s vision for both the party and the nation and recited a quote from shakespeare s romeo and juliet ( . ) that jacqueline had given him when he shall die take him and cut him out in little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. the ten month investigation by the warren commission of – concluded that the president had been assassinated by lee harvey oswald and that oswald had acted alone. on september , , kennedy issued a statement through his new york campaign office as i said in poland last summer, i am convinced oswald was solely responsible for what happened and that he did not have any outside help or assistance. he was a malcontent who could not get along here or in the soviet union. he added, i have not read the report, nor do i intend to. but i have been briefed on it and i am completely satisfied that the commission investigated every lead and examined every piece of evidence. the commission s inquiry was thorough and conscientious. after a meeting with kennedy in , arthur m. schlesinger jr. wrote it is evident that he believes that the warren commission s report was a poor job and will not endorse it, but that he is unwilling to criticize it and thereby reopen the whole tragic business. jerry bruno, an advance man for jfk who also worked on rfk s presidential campaign, would later state in i talked to robert kennedy many times about the warren commission, and he never doubted their result. in a interview with cbs journalist charlie rose, son robert f. kennedy jr. stated that his father was fairly convinced that others besides oswald were involved in his brother s assassination and that he privately believed the commission s report was a shoddy piece of craftsmanship . the killing was judged as having a profound impact on kennedy. beran assesses the assassination as having moved kennedy away from reliance on the political system and become more questioning. tye views kennedy following the death of his brother as more fatalistic, having seen how fast he could lose what he cherished the most. vice presidential candidate robert kennedy with david dubinsky in an undated photo. the sign in the background reads, for president lyndon b. johnson . in the wake of the assassination of his brother and lyndon johnson s ascension to the presidency, with the office of vice president now vacant, kennedy was viewed favorably as a potential candidate for the position in the presidential election. several kennedy partisans called for him to be drafted in tribute to his brother; national polling showing that three of four democrats were in favor of him as johnson s running mate. democratic organizers supported him as a write in candidate in the new hampshire primary and , democrats wrote in kennedy s name in march , only , fewer than the number of democrats who wrote in johnson s name as their pick for president. kennedy discussed the vice presidency with arthur schlesinger. schlesinger thought that he should develop his own political base first, and kennedy observed that the job was really based on waiting around for someone to die . in his first interview after the assassination kennedy said he was not considering the vice presidency. during this time he said of the coalescing johnson administration, it s too early for me to even think about , because i don t know whether i want to have any part of these people. ... if they don t fulfill and follow out my brother s program, i don t want to have anything to do with them. however, in january kennedy did begin low key inquiries as to the vice presidential position and by the summer was developing plans to help johnson in cities and in the northeast based on the jfk campaign strategies. despite the fanfare within the democratic party, president johnson was not inclined to have kennedy on his ticket. the two men disliked one another intensely, with feelings often described as mutual contempt that went back to their first meeting in and had only intensified during jfk s presidency. johnson instead chose hubert humphrey to be his running mate. during a post presidency interview with historian doris kearns goodwin, johnson claimed that kennedy acted like he was the custodian of the kennedy dream despite johnson being seen as this after jfk was assassinated, arguing that he had waited his turn and kennedy should have done the same. johnson recalled a tidal wave of letters and memos about how great a vice president bobby would be being swept upon him, but knowing that he could not let it happen as he viewed the possibility of having kennedy on the ticket as ensuring that he would never know if he could be elected on my own . in july , johnson issued an official statement ruling out all of his current cabinet members as potential running mates, judging them to be so valuable ... in their current posts . in response to this statement, angry letters poured in directed towards both johnson and his wife, lady bird, expressing disappointment at kennedy being dropped from the field of potential running mates. johnson, worried that delegates at the convention would draft kennedy onto the ticket, ordered the fbi to monitor kennedy s contacts, actions, and to make sure that he could not speak until after hubert humphrey was confirmed as his running mate. u.s. senate ( – ) election see also united states senate election in new york, kennedy at the democratic national convention nine months after his brother s assassination, kennedy left the cabinet to run for a seat in the u.s. senate representing new york, announcing his candidacy on august , , two days before that year s democratic national convention. he had considered the possibility of running since early spring, but also giving consideration to leaving politics altogether after the plane crash and injury of his brother ted in june, two months earlier. positive reception in europe convinced him to remain in politics. kennedy was lauded during concurrent trips to germany and poland, the denizens of the latter country s greetings to kennedy being interpreted by leaming as evaporating the agony he had sustained since his brother s passing. kennedy was given permission to run by the new york state democratic committee on september , amid mixed feelings in regards to his candidacy. despite their notoriously difficult relationship, johnson gave considerable support to kennedy s campaign. his opponent in the race was republican incumbent kenneth keating, who attempted to portray kennedy as an arrogant carpetbagger from massachusetts. rfk charged keating with having not done much of anything constructive despite his presence in congress during a september press conference. kennedy won the november election, helped in part by johnson s huge victory margin in new york. tenure kennedy drew attention in congress early on as the brother of president kennedy, which set him apart from other senators. he drew more than fifty senators as spectators when he delivered a speech in the senate on nuclear proliferation in june . however, he also saw a decline in his power, going from the president s most trusted advisor to one of a hundred senators, and his impatience with collaborative lawmaking showed. though fellow senator fred r. harris expected not to like kennedy, the two became allies; harris even called them each other s best friends in the senate . kennedy s younger brother ted was his senior there. robert saw his brother as a guide on managing within the senate and the arrangement worked to deepen their relationship. senator harris noted that kennedy was intense about matters and issues which concerned him. kennedy gained a reputation in the senate for being well prepared for debate, however his tendency to speak to other senators in a more blunt fashion caused him to be unpopular ... with many of his colleagues . president lyndon b. johnson signs the immigration act of as ted and robert kennedy, and others look on while serving in the senate, kennedy advocated gun control. in may he co sponsored s. , proposed by president johnson and sponsored by senator thomas j. dodd, that would put federal restrictions on mail order gun sales. speaking in support of the bill, kennedy said, for too long we dealt with these deadly weapons as if they were harmless toys. yet their very presence, the ease of their acquisition and the familiarity of their appearance have led to thousands of deaths each year. with the passage of this bill we will begin to meet our responsibilities. it would save hundreds of thousands of lives in this country and spare thousands of families ... grief and heartache. ... in remarks during a may campaign stop in roseburg, oregon, kennedy defended the bill as keeping firearms away from people who have no business with guns or rifles . the bill forbade mail order sale of guns to the very young, those with criminal records and the insane, according to the oregonian s report. s. and subsequent bills, and the assassinations of martin luther king jr. and robert f. kennedy, paved the way for the eventual passage of the gun control act of . kennedy and his staff had employed a cautionary amendments–only strategy for his first year in the senate. in and they took more direct legislative action, but were met with increasing resistance from the johnson administration. despite perceptions that the two were hostile in their respective offices to each other, u.s. news reported kennedy s support of the johnson administration s great society program through his voting record. kennedy supported both major and minor parts of the program, and each year over % of his roll call votes were consistently in favor of johnson s policies. on february , , kennedy urged the united states to pledge that it would not be the first country to use nuclear weapons against countries that did not have them noting that china had made the pledge and the soviet union indicated it was also willing to do so. in june , he visited apartheid era south africa accompanied by his wife, ethel, and a few aides. the tour was greeted with international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of south africa. he spoke out against the oppression of the native population, and was welcomed by the black population as though he were a visiting head of state. in an interview with look magazine he said at the university of natal in durban, i was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. a questioner declared that few churches allow black africans to pray with the white because the bible says that is the way it should be, because god created negroes to serve. but suppose god is black , i replied. what if we go to heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the negro as an inferior, and god is there, and we look up and he is not white? what then is our response? there was no answer. only silence. at the university of cape town he delivered the annual day of affirmation address. a quote from this address appears on his memorial at arlington national cemetery each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope. on january , , kennedy began a ten day stay in europe, meeting harold wilson in london and advising him to tell president johnson about his belief that the ongoing vietnam conflict was wrong. upon returning to the u.s. in early february, he was confronted by the press who asked him if his conversations abroad had negatively impacted american foreign relations. kennedy speaks with a youth while touring bedford–stuyvesant in brooklyn, n.y. during his years as a senator, he helped to start a successful redevelopment project in poverty stricken bedford–stuyvesant, brooklyn, in new york city. schlesinger wrote that kennedy had hoped bedford stuyvesant would become an example of self imposed growth for other impoverished neighborhoods. kennedy had difficulty securing support from president johnson, whose administration was charged by kennedy as having opposed a special impact program meant to bring about the federal progress that he had supported. robert b. semple jr. repeated similar sentiments in september , writing the johnson administration was preparing a concentrated attack on robert f. kennedy s proposal that semple claimed would build more and better low cost housing in the slums through private enterprise. kennedy confided to journalist jack newfield that while he tried collaborating with the administration through courting its members and compromising with the bill, they didn t even try to work something out together. to them it s all just politics. he also visited the mississippi delta as a member of the senate committee reviewing the effectiveness of war on poverty programs, particularly that of the economic opportunity act of . marian wright edelman described kennedy as deeply moved and outraged by the sight of the starving children living in the economically abysmal climate, changing her impression of him from tough, arrogant, and politically driven. edelman noted further that the senator requested she call on martin luther king jr. to bring the impoverished to washington, d.c., to make them more visible, leading to the creation of the poor people s campaign. kennedy worked on the senate labor committee at the time of the workers rights activism of cesar chavez, dolores huerta, and the national farm workers association (nfwa). at the request of labor leader walter reuther, who had previously marched with and provided money to chavez, kennedy flew out to delano, california, to investigate the situation. although little attention was paid to the first two committee hearings in march for legislation to include farm workers by an amendment of the national labor relations act, kennedy s attendance at the third hearing brought media coverage. biographer thomas wrote that kennedy was moved after seeing the conditions of the workers, who he deemed were being taken advantage of. chavez stressed to kennedy that migrant workers needed to be recognized as human beings. kennedy later engaged in an exchange with kern county sheriff leroy galyen where he criticized the sheriff s deputies for taking photographs of people on picket lines. as a senator, he was popular among african americans and other minorities including native americans and immigrant groups. he spoke forcefully in favor of what he called the disaffected , the impoverished, and the excluded , thereby aligning himself with leaders of the civil rights struggle and social justice campaigners, leading the democratic party in pursuit of a more aggressive agenda to eliminate perceived discrimination on all levels. he supported desegregation busing, integration of all public facilities, the voting rights act of , and anti poverty social programs to increase education, offer opportunities for employment, and provide health care for african americans. consistent with president kennedy s alliance for progress, he also placed increasing emphasis on human rights as a central focus of u.s. foreign policy. vietnam the jfk administration had backed u.s. involvement in southeast asia and other parts of the world in the frame of the cold war, but kennedy was not known to be involved in discussions on the vietnam war when he was his brother s attorney general. according to historian doris kearns goodwin, before choosing to run for the senate, kennedy had sought an ambassadorship to south vietnam. entering the senate, kennedy initially kept private his disagreements with president johnson on the war. while kennedy vigorously supported his brother s earlier efforts, he never publicly advocated commitment of ground troops. though bothered by the beginning of the bombing of north vietnam in february , kennedy did not wish to appear antipathetic to the president s agenda. but by april, kennedy was advocating a halt to the bombing to johnson, who acknowledged that kennedy played a part in influencing his choice to temporarily cease bombing the following month. kennedy cautioned johnson against sending combat troops as early as , but johnson chose instead to follow the recommendation of the rest of his predecessor s still intact staff of advisers. in july, after johnson made a large commitment of american ground forces to vietnam, kennedy made multiple calls for a settlement through negotiation. the next month, john paul vann, a lieutenant colonel in the u.s. army, wrote that kennedy indicat ed comprehension of the problems we face , in a letter to the senator. senator robert f. kennedy and president lyndon b. johnson in the oval office, in april , kennedy had a private meeting with philip heymann of the state department s bureau of security and consular affairs to discuss efforts to secure the release of american prisoners of war in vietnam. kennedy wanted to press the johnson administration to do more, but heymann insisted that the administration believed the consequences of sitting down with the viet cong mattered more than the prisoners they were holding captive. on june of that year, kennedy released a statement disavowing president johnson s choice to bomb haiphong, but he avoided criticizing either the war or the president s overall foreign policy, believing that it might harm democratic candidates in the midterm elections. in august, the international herald tribune described kennedy s popularity as outpacing president johnson s, crediting kennedy s attempts to end the vietnam conflict which the public increasingly desired. in the early part of , kennedy traveled to europe, where he had discussions about vietnam with leaders and diplomats. a story leaked to the state department that kennedy was talking about seeking peace while president johnson was pursuing the war. johnson became convinced that kennedy was undermining his authority. he voiced this during a meeting with kennedy, who reiterated the interest of the european leaders to pause the bombing while going forward with negotiations; johnson declined to do so. on march , kennedy outlined a three point plan to end the war which included suspending the u.s. bombing of north vietnam, and the eventual withdrawal of american and north vietnamese soldiers from south vietnam; this plan was rejected by secretary of state dean rusk, who believed north vietnam would never agree to it. on may , kennedy debated governor of california ronald reagan about the war. on november , , during an appearance on face the nation, kennedy asserted that the johnson administration had deviated from his brother s policies in vietnam, his first time contrasting the two administrations policies on the war. he added that the view that americans were fighting to end communism in vietnam was immoral . on february , , kennedy delivered an address in chicago, illinois, where he critiqued saigon government corruption and expressed his disagreement with the johnson administration s stance that the war would determine the future of asia. on march , kennedy met with defense secretary clark clifford at the pentagon regarding the war. clifford s notes indicate that kennedy was offering not to enter the ongoing democratic presidential primary if president johnson would admit publicly to having been wrong in his war policy and appoint a group of persons to conduct a study in depth of the issues and come up with a recommended course of action ; johnson rejected the proposal. on april , after president johnson halted bombing of north vietnam, rfk said the decision was a step toward peace and though offering to collaborate with johnson for national unity, opted to continue his presidential bid. on may , while in lafayette, indiana, kennedy said continued delays in beginning peace talks with north vietnam meant both more lives lost and the postponing of the domestic progress hoped for by the us. later that month, kennedy called the war the gravest kind of error in a speech in corvallis, oregon. in an interview on june , hours before he was shot, kennedy continued to advocate for a change in policy towards the war. despite his criticism of the vietnam war and the south vietnam government, kennedy also stated in his campaign brochure that he did not support either a simple withdrawal or a surrender in south vietnam and favored instead a change in the course of action taken so it would bring an honorable peace. presidential candidate main article robert f. kennedy presidential campaign, see also united states presidential election, and democratic national convention tired but still intense in the last days before his oregon defeat, robert kennedy speaks from the platform of a campaign train. in , president johnson prepared to run for re election. in january, faced with what was widely considered an unrealistic race against an incumbent president, kennedy stated that he would not seek the presidency. after the tet offensive in vietnam in early february , he received a letter from writer pete hamill that said poor people kept pictures of president kennedy on their walls and that kennedy had an obligation of staying true to whatever it was that put those pictures on those walls. kennedy traveled to delano, california, to meet with civil rights activist césar chávez, who was on a day hunger strike showing his commitment to nonviolence. it was on this visit to california that kennedy decided he would challenge johnson for the presidency, telling his former justice department aides, edwin guthman and peter edelman, that his first step was to get lesser known senator eugene mccarthy of minnesota to drop out of the presidential race. the weekend before the new hampshire primary, kennedy announced to several aides that he would attempt to persuade mccarthy to withdraw from the race to avoid splitting the antiwar vote, but senator george mcgovern urged kennedy to wait until after that primary to announce his candidacy. johnson won a narrow victory in the new hampshire primary on march , , against mccarthy, but this close second place result dramatically boosted mccarthy s standing in the race. after much speculation, and reports leaking out about his plans, and seeing in mccarthy s success that johnson s hold on the job was not as strong as originally thought, kennedy declared his candidacy on march , , in the caucus room of the old senate office building, the same room where his brother had declared his own candidacy eight years earlier. he stated, i do not run for the presidency merely to oppose any man, but to propose new policies. i run because i am convinced that this country is on a perilous course and because i have such strong feelings about what must be done, and i feel that i m obliged to do all i can. mccarthy supporters angrily denounced kennedy as an opportunist. they believed that mccarthy had taken the most courageous stand by opposing the sitting president of his own party and that his surprising result in new hampshire had earned him the mantle of being the anti war candidate. kennedy s announcement split the anti war movement in two. on march , , johnson stunned the nation by dropping out of the race. vice president hubert humphrey, a champion of the labor unions and a long supporter of civil rights, entered the race with the financial backing and critical endorsement of the party establishment , including most members of congress, mayors, governors, the south , and several major labor unions. with state registration deadlines long past, humphrey joined the race too late to enter any primaries but had the support of the president. kennedy, like his brother before him, planned to win the nomination through popular support in the primaries. robert kennedy campaigns in los angeles (photo by evan freed) kennedy ran on a platform of racial and economic justice, non aggression in foreign policy, decentralization of power, and social change. a crucial element of his campaign was an engagement with the young, whom he identified as being the future of a reinvigorated american society based on partnership and equality. his policy objectives did not sit well with the business community, where he was viewed as something of a fiscal liability, opposed as they were to the tax increases necessary to fund social programs. at one of his university speeches (indiana university medical school), he was asked, where are we going to get the money to pay for all these new programs you re proposing? he replied to the medical students, about to enter lucrative careers, from you. it was this intense and frank mode of dialogue with which he was to continue to engage those whom he viewed as not being traditional allies of democratic ideals or initiatives. in a speech at the university of alabama, he argued, i believe that any who seek high office this year must go before all americans, not just those who agree with them, but also those who disagree, recognizing that it is not just our supporters, not just those who vote for us, but all americans who we must lead in the difficult years ahead. he aroused rabid animosity in some quarters, with j. edgar hoover s deputy clyde tolson reported as saying, i hope that someone shoots and kills the son of a bitch. kennedy s presidential campaign brought out both great enthusiasm and anger in people. his message of change raised hope for some and brought fear to others. kennedy wanted to be a bridge across the divide of american society. his bid for the presidency saw not only a continuation of the programs he and his brother had undertaken during the president s term in office, but also an extension of johnson s great society. kennedy visited numerous small towns and made himself available to the masses by participating in long motorcades and street corner stump speeches, often in troubled inner cities. he made urban poverty a chief concern of his campaign, which in part led to enormous crowds that would attend his events in poor urban areas or rural parts of appalachia. kennedy giving his speech on martin luther king jr. on april , , kennedy learned of the assassination of martin luther king jr. and gave a heartfelt impromptu speech in indianapolis s inner city, calling for a reconciliation between the races. the address was the first time kennedy spoke publicly about his brother s killing. riots broke out in cities in the wake of king s death, but not in indianapolis, a fact many attribute to the effect of this speech. kennedy addressed the city club of cleveland the next day, on april , , delivering the famous on the mindless menace of violence speech. he attended king s funeral, accompanied by jacqueline and ted kennedy. he was described as being the only white politician to hear only cheers and applause. kennedy won the indiana democratic primary on may and the nebraska primary on may but lost the oregon primary to mccarthy on may . if he could defeat mccarthy in the california primary, the leadership of the campaign thought, he would knock mccarthy out of the race and set up a one on one against hubert humphrey at the chicago national convention in august. assassination main article assassination of robert f. kennedy kennedy scored a major victory when he won the california primary. he addressed his supporters shortly after midnight on june , , in a ballroom at the ambassador hotel in los angeles, california. leaving the ballroom, he went through the hotel kitchen after being told it was a shortcut to a press room. he did this despite being advised by his bodyguard — former fbi agent bill barry — to avoid the kitchen. in a crowded kitchen passageway, kennedy turned to his left and shook hands with busboy juan romero just as sirhan sirhan, a year old palestinian, opened fire with a . caliber revolver. kennedy was hit three times, and five other people were wounded. george plimpton, former decathlete rafer johnson, and former professional football player rosey grier are credited with wrestling sirhan to the ground after he shot the senator. as kennedy lay mortally wounded, juan romero cradled his head and placed a rosary in his hand. kennedy asked romero, is everybody ok? , and romero responded, yes, everybody s ok. kennedy then turned away from romero and said, everything s going to be ok. after several minutes, medical attendants arrived and lifted the senator onto a stretcher, prompting him to whisper, don t lift me , which were his last words. he lost consciousness shortly thereafter. he was rushed first to los angeles central receiving hospital, and then to the city s good samaritan hospital. despite extensive neurosurgery to remove the bullet and bone fragments from his brain, kennedy was pronounced dead at a.m. (pdt) on june , nearly hours after the shooting. robert kennedy s death, like the assassination of his brother, president john f. kennedy, has been the subject of conspiracy theories. funeral kennedy s body was returned to manhattan, where it lay in repose at saint patrick s cathedral from approximately p.m. until a.m. on june . a high requiem mass was held at the cathedral at a.m. on june . the service was attended by members of the extended kennedy family, president lyndon b. johnson and his wife lady bird johnson, and members of the johnson cabinet. ted, the only surviving kennedy brother, said the following my brother need not be idealized, or enlarged in death beyond what he was in life; to be remembered simply as a good and decent man, who saw wrong and tried to right it, saw suffering and tried to heal it, saw war and tried to stop it. those of us who loved him and who take him to his rest today, pray that what he was to us and what he wished for others will some day come to pass for all the world. as he said many times, in many parts of this nation, to those he touched and who sought to touch him some men see things as they are and say why. i dream things that never were and say why not. robert f. kennedy s grave in arlington national cemetery the requiem mass concluded with the hymn the battle hymn of the republic , sung by andy williams. immediately following the mass, kennedy s body was transported by a special private train to washington, d.c. kennedy s funeral train was pulled by two penn central gg electric locomotives. thousands of mourners lined the tracks and stations along the route, paying their respects as the train passed. the train departed new york at p.m. when it arrived in elizabeth, new jersey, an eastbound train on a parallel track to the funeral train hit and killed two spectators and seriously injured four, after they were unable to get off the track in time, even though the eastbound train s engineer had slowed to mph for the normally mph curve, blown his horn continuously, and rung his bell through the curve. the normally four hour trip took more than eight hours because of the thick crowds lining the tracks on the mile ( km) journey. the train was scheduled to arrive at about p.m., but sticking brakes on the casket bearing car contributed to delays, and the train finally arrived at p.m. on june . burial main article grave of robert f. kennedy kennedy was buried close to his brother john in arlington national cemetery in arlington, virginia, just across the potomac river from washington, d.c. although he had always maintained that he wished to be buried in massachusetts, his family believed robert should be interred in arlington next to his brother. the procession left union station and passed the new senate office building, where he had his offices, and then proceeded to the lincoln memorial, where it paused. the marine corps band played the battle hymn of the republic. the funeral motorcade arrived at the cemetery at p.m. as the vehicles entered the cemetery, people lining the roadway spontaneously lit candles to guide the motorcade to the burial site. the minute ceremony began at p.m. cardinal patrick o boyle, roman catholic archbishop of washington, officiated at the graveside service in lieu of cardinal richard cushing of boston, who fell ill during the trip. also officiating was archbishop of new york terence cooke. on behalf of the united states, john glenn presented the folded flag to senator ted kennedy, who passed it to robert s eldest son, joe, who passed it to ethel kennedy. the navy band played the navy hymn. officials at arlington national cemetery said that kennedy s burial was the only night burial to have taken place at the cemetery. (the re interment of patrick bouvier kennedy, who died two days after his birth in august , and a stillborn daughter, arabella, both children of president kennedy and his wife, jacqueline, also occurred at night. after the president was interred in arlington cemetery, the two infants were buried next to him on december , , in a private ceremony without publicity.) on june , president lyndon b. johnson assigned security staff to all u.s. presidential candidates and declared an official national day of mourning. after the assassination, the mandate of the u.s. secret service was altered by congress to include the protection of u.s. presidential candidates. robert f. kennedy memorial built in across from his grave in arlington national cemetery personal life family the kennedy brothers. presidential candidate john f. kennedy, bobby, and ted, july on june , , kennedy married socialite ethel skakel, the third daughter of businessman george and ann skakel (née brannack), at st. mary s catholic church in greenwich, connecticut. the couple had children; kathleen (b. ), joseph (b. ), robert jr. (b. ), david ( – ), courtney (b. ), michael ( – ), kerry (b. ), christopher (b. ), max (b. ), douglas (b. ), and rory (b. december , after her father s assassination). kennedy owned a home at the well known kennedy compound on cape cod, in hyannis port, massachusetts, but spent most of his time at his estate in mclean, virginia, known as hickory hill, located west of washington, d.c. his widow, ethel, and their children continued to live at hickory hill after his death. she now lives full time at the hyannis port home. citation needed attitudes and approach kennedy was said to be the gentlest and shyest of the family, as well as the least articulate orally. by the time he was a young boy, his grandmother, josie fitzgerald, worried he would become a sissy . his mother had a similar concern, as he was the smallest and thinnest , but soon afterward, the family discovered there was no fear of that . family friend lem billings met kennedy when he was years old and would later reflect that he loved him, adding that kennedy was the nicest little boy i ever met . billings also said kennedy was barely noticed in the early days, but that s because he didn t bother anybody . luella hennessey, who became the nurse for the kennedy children when kennedy was , called him the most thoughtful and considerate of his siblings. kennedy was teased by his siblings, as in their family it was a norm for humor to be displayed in that fashion. he would turn jokes on himself or remain silent. despite his gentle demeanor, he could be outspoken, and once engaged a priest in a public argument that horrified his mother, who later conceded that he had been correct all along. even when arguing for a noble cause, his comments could have a cutting quality . although joe kennedy s most ambitious dreams centered around bobby s older brothers, bobby maintained the code of personal loyalty that seemed to infuse the life of his family. his competitiveness was admired by his father and elder brothers, while his loyalty bound them more affectionately close. a rather timid child, he was often the target of his father s dominating temperament. working on the campaigns of older brother john, he was more involved, passionate, and tenacious than the candidate himself, obsessed with detail, fighting out every battle, and taking workers to task. he had always been closer to john than the other members of the family. kennedy s opponents on capitol hill maintained that his collegiate magnanimity was sometimes hindered by a tenacious and somewhat impatient manner. his professional life was dominated by the same attitudes that governed his family life a certainty that good humor and leisure must be balanced by service and accomplishment. schlesinger comments that kennedy could be both the most ruthlessly diligent and yet generously adaptable of politicians, at once both temperamental and forgiving. in this he was very much his father s son, lacking truly lasting emotional independence, and yet possessing a great desire to contribute. he lacked the innate self confidence of his contemporaries yet found a greater self assurance in the experience of married life, an experience that he stated had given him a base of self belief from which to continue his efforts in the public arena. upon hearing yet again the assertion that he was ruthless , kennedy once joked to a reporter, if i find out who has called me ruthless i will destroy him. he also confessed to possessing a bad temper that required self control my biggest problem as counsel is to keep my temper. i think we all feel that when a witness comes before the united states senate, he has an obligation to speak frankly and tell the truth. to see people sit in front of us and lie and evade makes me boil inside. but you can t lose your temper; if you do, the witness has gotten the best of you. attorney michael o donnell wrote, kennedy offered that most intoxicating of political aphrodisiacs authenticity. he was blunt to a fault, and his favorite campaign activity was arguing with college students. to many, his idealistic opportunism was irresistible. in his earlier life, kennedy had developed a reputation as the family s attack dog. he was a hostile cross examiner on joseph mccarthy s senate committee; a fixer and leg breaker as jfk s campaign manager; an unforgiving and merciless cutthroat—his father s son right down to joseph kennedy s purported observation that he hates like me. yet bobby kennedy somehow became a liberal icon, an antiwar visionary who tried to outflank lyndon johnson s great society from the left. religious faith and greek philosophy kennedy s catholicism was central to his politics and personal attitude to life and its purpose; he inherited his faith from his family. he was more religious than his brothers and approached his duties with a catholic worldview. throughout his life, he made reference to his faith, how it informed every area of his life, and how it gave him the strength to re enter politics following his older brother s assassination. his was not an unresponsive and staid faith, but the faith of a catholic radical, perhaps the first successful catholic radical in american political history. in the last years of his life, he also found great solace in the playwrights and poets of ancient greece, especially the writings of aeschylus, suggested to him by jacqueline after jfk s death. in his indianapolis speech on april , , following the assassination of martin luther king jr., kennedy slightly misquoted these lines from aeschylus even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart, until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of god. legacy .mw parser output .quotebox background color #f f f ;border px solid #aaa;box sizing border box;padding px;font size % .mw parser output .quotebox.floatleft margin . em . em . em .mw

none!important kennedy s approach to national problems did not fit neatly into the idealogical categories of his time ... his was a muscular liberalism, committed to an activist federal government but deeply suspicious of concentrated power and certain that fundamental change would best be achieved at the community level, insistent on responsibilities as well as rights, and convinced that the dynamism of capitalism could be the impetus for broadening national growth. edwin o. guthman and c. richard allen, kennedy was the first sibling of a president of the united states to serve as u.s. attorney general. biographer evan thomas wrote that, at times kennedy misused his powers by modern standards , but concluded, on the whole, even counting his warts, he was a great attorney general. walter isaacson commented that kennedy turned out arguably to be the best attorney general in history , praising him for his championing of civil rights and other initiatives of the administration. as kennedy stepped down from being attorney general in to assume the office of senator from new york, the new york times, notably having criticized his appointment three years prior, praised kennedy for raising the standards of the position. some of his successor attorneys general have been unfavorably compared to him, for not displaying the same level of poise in the profession. near the end of his time in office as attorney general under barack obama, eric holder cited kennedy as the inspiration for his belief that the justice department could be a force for that which is right. kennedy has also been praised for his oratorical abilities and his skill at creating unity. joseph a. palermo of the huffington post observed that kennedy s words could cut through social boundaries and partisan divides in a way that seems nearly impossible today. dolores huerta and philip w. johnston expressed the view that kennedy, both in his speeches and actions, was unique in his willingness to take political risks. that blunt sincerity was said by associates to be authentic; frank n. magill wrote that kennedy s oratorical skills lent their support to minorities and other disenfranchised groups who began seeing him as an ally. kennedy s assassination was a blow to the optimism for a brighter future that his campaign had brought for many americans who lived through the turbulent s. juan romero, the busboy who shook hands with kennedy right before he was shot, later said, it made me realize that no matter how much hope you have it can be taken away in a second. kennedy s death has been cited as a significant factor in the democratic party s loss of the presidential election. since his passing, kennedy has become generally well respected by liberals and conservatives, which is far from the polarized views of him during his lifetime. joe scarborough, john ashcroft, tom bradley, mark dayton, john kitzhaber, max cleland, tim cook, phil bredesen, joe biden, j. k. rowling, jim mcgreevey, gavin newsom, and ray mabus have acknowledged kennedy s influence on them. josh zeitz of politico observed, bobby kennedy has since become an american folk hero—the tough, crusading liberal gunned down in the prime of life. kennedy s (and to a lesser extent his older brother s) ideas about using government authority to assist less fortunate peoples became central to american liberalism as a tenet of the kennedy legacy . honors president george w. bush dedicates the justice department building in honor of robert kennedy as ethel kennedy looks on. in the months and years after robert f. kennedy s death, numerous roads, public schools, and other facilities across the united states have been named in his memory. the robert f. kennedy center for justice and human rights was founded in , with an international award program to recognize human rights activists. the sports stadium d.c. stadium in washington, d.c., was renamed robert f. kennedy memorial stadium in . in , the united states congress awarded kennedy its gold medal of honor. on january , , a cent commemorative u.s. postal service stamp (u.s. # ) was issued in washington.d.c., honoring r.f.k. the bureau of engraving and printing distributed , , of the perforated, blue and white stamps an unusually large printing. the stamp design was taken from a family photo suggested by his wife, ethel kennedy. in , the united states mint released a special dollar coin that featured his image on the obverse and the emblems of the united states department of justice and the united states senate on the reverse. on november , , u.s. president george w. bush and attorney general john ashcroft dedicated the department of justice headquarters building in washington, d.c., as the robert f. kennedy department of justice building, honoring kennedy on what would have been his th birthday. they both spoke during the ceremony, as did kennedy s eldest son, joseph. the robert f. kennedy special dollar coin in a further effort to remember kennedy and continue his work helping disadvantaged, a small group of private citizens launched the robert f. kennedy children s action corps in , which today helps more than abused and neglected children each year. a bust of kennedy resides in the library of the university of virginia school of law where he obtained his law degree. on june , (the eve of the th anniversary of his assassination), the new york state assembly voted to rename the triborough bridge in new york city the robert f. kennedy memorial bridge. new york state governor david paterson signed the legislation into law on august , . the bridge is now commonly known as the rfk triborough bridge. on september , , the united states navy announced the renaming of a refueling ship in honor of kennedy during a ceremony attended by members of his family. personal items and documents from his office in the justice department building are displayed in a permanent exhibit dedicated to him at the john f. kennedy library and museum. papers from his years as attorney general, senator, peace and civil rights activist and presidential candidate, as well as personal correspondence, are also housed in the library. established in , the robert f. kennedy assassination archives stored at the university of massachusetts dartmouth contains thousands of copies of government documents obtained through the freedom of information act public disclosure process as well as manuscripts, photographs, audiotape interviews, video tapes, news clippings and research notes compiled by journalists and other private citizens who have investigated discrepancies in the case. kennedy and martin luther king, jr. several public institutions jointly honor kennedy and martin luther king jr. in , the former woodrow wilson junior college, a two year institution and a constituent campus of the city colleges of chicago, was renamed kennedy–king college. in , the city of indianapolis erected the landmark for peace memorial in robert kennedy s honor near the space made famous by his speech from the back of a pickup truck the night king died. the monument in martin luther king jr. memorial park depicts a sculpture of rfk reaching out from a large metal slab to a sculpture of king, who is part of a similar slab. this is meant to symbolize their attempts in life to bridge the gaps between the races—an attempt that united them even in death. a state historical marker has also been placed at the site. a nephew of king and indiana u.s. congresswoman julia carson presided over the event; both made speeches from the back of a pickup truck in similar fashion to rfk s speech. writings kennedy wrote extensively on politics and current events the enemy within the mcclellan committee s crusade against jimmy hoffa and

malenkov brezhnev → nikita sergeyevich khrushchev a ( april – september ) was a soviet statesman who led the soviet union during part of the cold war as the first secretary of the communist party of the soviet union from to , and as chairman of the council of ministers, or premier, from to . khrushchev was responsible for the de stalinization of the soviet union, for backing the progress of the early soviet space program, and for several relatively liberal reforms in areas of domestic policy. khrushchev s party colleagues removed him from power in , replacing him with leonid brezhnev as first secretary and alexei kosygin as premier. khrushchev was born in in the village of kalinovka, which is close to the present day border between russia and ukraine. he was employed as a metal worker during his youth, and he was a political commissar during the russian civil war. with the help of lazar kaganovich, he worked his way up the soviet hierarchy. he supported joseph stalin s purges, and approved thousands of arrests. in , stalin sent him to govern ukraine, and he continued the purges there. during what was known in the soviet union as the great patriotic war (eastern front of world war ii), khrushchev was again a commissar, serving as an intermediary between stalin and his generals. khrushchev was present at the bloody defense of stalingrad, a fact he took great pride in throughout his life. after the war, he returned to ukraine before being recalled to moscow as one of stalin s close advisers. on march , the death of stalin triggered a power struggle in which khrushchev emerged victorious after consolidating his leadership of the party with that of the council of ministers. on february , at the th party congress, he delivered the secret speech , which denounced stalin s purges and ushered in a less repressive era in the soviet union. his domestic policies, aimed at bettering the lives of ordinary citizens, were often ineffective, especially in agriculture. hoping eventually to rely on missiles for national defense, khrushchev ordered major cuts in conventional forces. despite the cuts, khrushchev s rule saw the most tense years of the cold war, culminating in the cuban missile crisis. khrushchev s popularity was eroded by flaws in his policies. this emboldened his potential opponents, who quietly rose in strength and deposed the premier in october . however, he did not suffer the deadly fate of previous soviet power struggles, and was pensioned off with an apartment in moscow and a dacha in the countryside. his lengthy memoirs were smuggled to the west and published in part in . khrushchev died in of a heart attack. contents early years party official . donbas years . kaganovich protégé . involvement in purges world

oblast, near the present ukrainian border. his parents, sergei khrushchev and xeniya khrushcheva, were poor peasants of russian origin, and had a daughter two years nikita s junior, irina. sergei khrushchev was employed in a number of positions in the donbas area of far eastern ukraine, working as a railwayman, as a miner, and labouring in a brick factory. wages were much higher in the donbas than in the kursk region, and sergei khrushchev generally left his family in kalinovka, returning there when he had enough money. kalinovka was a peasant village; khrushchev s teacher, lydia shevchenko, later stated that she had never seen a village as poor as kalinovka had been. nikita worked as a herdsboy from an early age. he was schooled for a total of four years, part in the village parochial school and part under shevchenko s tutelage in kalinovka s state school. according to khrushchev in his memoirs, shevchenko was a freethinker who upset the villagers by not attending church, and when her brother visited, he gave the boy books which had been banned by the imperial government. she urged nikita to seek further education, but family finances did not permit this. in , sergei khrushchev moved to the donbas city of yuzovka (now donetsk, ukraine); fourteen year old nikita followed later that year, while ksenia khrushcheva and her daughter came after. yuzovka, which was renamed stalino in and donetsk in , was at the heart of one of the most industrialized areas of the russian empire. after the boy worked briefly in other fields, khrushchev s parents found him a place as a metal fitter s apprentice. upon completing that apprenticeship, the teenage khrushchev was hired by a factory. he lost that job when he collected money for the families of the victims of the lena goldfields massacre, and was hired to mend underground equipment by a mine in nearby rutchenkovo, where his father was the union organiser, and he helped distribute copies and organise public readings of pravda. he later stated that he considered emigrating to the united states for better wages, but did not do so. khrushchev and his first wife euphrasinia (yefrosinia) in when world war i broke out in , khrushchev was exempt from conscription because he was a skilled metal worker. he was employed by a workshop that serviced ten mines, and he was involved in several strikes that demanded higher pay, better working conditions, and an end to the war. in , he married yefrosinia pisareva, daughter of the lift operator at the rutchenkovo mine. in , they had a daughter, yulia, and in , a son, leonid. after the abdication of tsar nicholas ii in , the new russian provisional government in petrograd had little influence over ukraine. khrushchev was elected to the worker s council (or soviet) in rutchenkovo, and in may he became its chairman. he did not join the bolsheviks until , a year in which the russian civil war, between the bolsheviks and a coalition of opponents known as the white army, began in earnest. his biographer, william taubman, suggests that khrushchev s delay in affiliating himself with the bolsheviks was because he felt closer to the mensheviks who prioritised economic progress, whereas the bolsheviks sought political power. in his memoirs, khrushchev indicated that he waited because there were many groups, and it was difficult to keep them all straight. in march , as the bolshevik government concluded a separate peace with the central powers, the germans occupied the donbas and khrushchev fled to kalinovka. in late or early he was mobilized into the red army as a political commissar. the post of political commissar had recently been introduced as the bolsheviks came to rely less on worker activists and more on military recruits; its functions included indoctrination of recruits in the tenets of bolshevism, and promoting troop morale and battle readiness. beginning as commissar to a construction platoon, khrushchev rose to become commissar to a construction battalion and was sent from the front for a two month political course. the young commissar came under fire many times, though many of the war stories he would tell in later life dealt more with his (and his troops ) cultural awkwardness, rather than with combat. in , the civil war ended, and khrushchev was demobilised and assigned as commissar to a labour brigade in the donbas, where he and his men lived in poor conditions. the wars had caused widespread devastation and famine, and one of the victims of the hunger and disease was khrushchev s wife, yefrosinia, who died of typhus in kalinovka while khrushchev was in the army. the commissar returned for the funeral and, loyal to his bolshevik principles, refused to allow his wife s coffin to enter the local church. with the only way into the churchyard through the church, he had the coffin lifted and passed over the fence into the burial ground, shocking the village. party official edit donbas years edit through the intervention of a friend, khrushchev was assigned in as assistant director for political affairs for the rutchenkovo mine in the donbas region, where he had previously worked. there were as yet few bolsheviks in the area. at that time, the movement was split by lenin s new economic policy, which allowed for some measure of private enterprise and was seen as an ideological retreat by some bolsheviks. while khrushchev s responsibility lay in political affairs, he involved himself in the practicalities of resuming full production at the mine after the chaos of the war years. he helped restart the machines (key parts and papers had been removed by the pre soviet mineowners) and he wore his old mine outfit for inspection tours. khrushchev s third wife was ukrainian born nina petrovna kukharchuk, whom he met in khrushchev was highly successful at the rutchenkovo mine, and in mid he was offered the directorship of the nearby pastukhov mine. however, he refused the offer, seeking to be assigned to the newly established technical college (tekhnikum) in yuzovka, though his superiors were reluctant to let him go. as he had only four years of formal schooling, he applied to the training program (rabfak) attached to the tekhnikum that was designed to bring undereducated students to high school level, a prerequisite for entry into the tekhnikum. while enrolled in the rabfak, khrushchev continued his work at the rutchenkovo mine. one of his teachers later described him as a poor student. he was more successful in advancing in the communist party; soon after his admission to the rabfak in august , he was appointed party secretary of the entire tekhnikum, and became a member of the bureau—the governing council—of the party committee for the town of yuzovka (renamed stalino in ). he briefly joined supporters of leon trotsky against those of joseph stalin over the question of party democracy. all of these activities left him with little time for his schoolwork, and while he later claimed to have finished his rabfak studies, it is unclear whether this was true. in , khrushchev met and married his second wife, marusia, whose maiden name is unknown. the two soon separated, though khrushchev helped marusia in later years, especially when marusia s daughter by a previous relationship suffered a fatal illness. soon after the abortive marriage, khrushchev met nina petrovna kukharchuk, a well educated party organizer and daughter of well to do ukrainian peasants. the two lived together as husband and wife for the rest of khrushchev s life, though they did not register their marriage until . they had three children together daughter rada was born in , son sergei in and daughter elena in . in mid , khrushchev was appointed party secretary of the petrovo marinsky raikom, or district, near stalino. the raikom was about square miles ( , km ) in area, and khrushchev was constantly on the move throughout his domain, taking an interest in even minor matters. in late , khrushchev was elected a non voting delegate to the th congress of the ussr communist party in moscow. kaganovich protégé edit nkvd chief genrikh yagoda (middle) inspecting the construction of the moscow volga canal, . khrushchev is left behind yagoda. khrushchev met lazar kaganovich as early as . in , kaganovich became party head in ukraine and khrushchev, falling under his patronage, was rapidly promoted. he was appointed second in command of the stalino party apparatus in late . within nine months his superior, konstantin moiseyenko, was ousted, which, according to taubman, was due to khrushchev s instigation. kaganovich transferred khrushchev to kharkov, then the capital of ukraine, as head of the organizational department of the ukrainian party s central committee. in , khrushchev was transferred to kiev, where he served as second in command of the party organization there. in , khrushchev again sought to further his education, following kaganovich (now in the kremlin as a close associate of stalin) to moscow and enrolling in the stalin industrial academy. khrushchev never completed his studies there, but his career in the party flourished. when the school s party cell elected a number of rightists to an upcoming district party conference, the cell was attacked in pravda. khrushchev emerged victorious in the ensuing power struggle, becoming party secretary of the school, arranging for the delegates to be withdrawn, and afterward purging the cell of the rightists. khrushchev rose rapidly through the party ranks, first becoming party leader for the bauman district, site of the academy, before taking the same position in the krasnopresnensky district, the capital s largest and most important. by , khrushchev had become second in command, behind kaganovich, of the moscow city party organization, and in , he became party leader for the city and a member of the party s central committee. khrushchev attributed his rapid rise to his acquaintance with fellow academy student nadezhda alliluyeva, stalin s wife. in his memoirs, khrushchev stated that alliluyeva spoke well of him to her husband. his biographer, william tompson, downplays the possibility, stating that khrushchev was too low in the party hierarchy to enjoy stalin s patronage, and that if influence was brought to bear on khrushchev s career at this stage, it was by kaganovich. while head of the moscow city organization, khrushchev superintended construction of the moscow metro, a highly expensive undertaking, with kaganovich in overall charge. faced with an already announced opening date of november , khrushchev took considerable risks in the construction and spent much of his time down in the tunnels. when the inevitable accidents did occur, they were depicted as heroic sacrifices in a great cause. the metro did not open until may , but khrushchev received the order of lenin for his role in its construction. later that year, he was selected as first secretary of the moscow regional committee which was responsible for moscow oblast, a province with a population of million. involvement in purges edit nestor lakoba, khrushchev, lavrenti beria and aghasi khanjian during opening of the moscow metro in . stalin s office records show meetings at which khrushchev was present as early as . the two increasingly built a good relationship. khrushchev greatly admired the dictator and treasured informal meetings with him and invitations to stalin s dacha, while stalin felt warm affection for his young subordinate. khrushchev (sitting first from left), head of moscow party branch, with various regional party leaders in . standing first from right is mir jafar baghirov beginning in , stalin began a campaign of political repression known as the great purge, during which millions of people were executed or sent to the gulag. central to this campaign were the moscow trials, a series of show trials of the purged top leaders of the party and the military. in , as the trials proceeded, khrushchev expressed his vehement support everyone who rejoices in the successes achieved in our country, the victories of our party led by the great stalin, will find only one word suitable for the mercenary, fascist dogs of the trotskyite zinovievite gang. that word is execution. khrushchev assisted in the purge of many friends and colleagues in moscow oblast. of top party officials in moscow city and province, were killed —the three survivors were transferred to other parts of the ussr. of the party secretaries of cities and districts outside moscow city in the province, only survived the purges. in his memoirs, khrushchev noted that almost everyone who worked with him was arrested. by party protocol, khrushchev was required to approve these arrests, and did little or nothing to save his friends and colleagues. party leaders were given numerical quotas of enemies to be turned in and arrested. in june , the politburo set a quota of , enemies to be arrested in moscow province; , of these were to be executed. in reply, khrushchev asked that , wealthy peasants, or kulaks living in moscow be killed in part fulfillment of the quota. in any event, only two weeks after receiving the politburo order, khrushchev was able to report to stalin that , criminal and kulak elements had been arrested. of the arrestees, according to khrushchev, , deserved execution. khrushchev had no reason to think himself immune from the purges, and in , confessed his own dalliance with trotskyism to kaganovich, who, according to khrushchev, blanched (for his protégé s sins could affect his own standing) and advised him to tell stalin. the dictator took the confession in his stride, and, after initially advising khrushchev to keep it quiet, suggested that khrushchev tell his tale to the moscow party conference. khrushchev did so, to applause, and was immediately reelected to his post. khrushchev related in his memoirs that he was also denounced by an arrested colleague. stalin told khrushchev of the accusation personally, looking him in the eye and awaiting his response. khrushchev speculated in his memoirs that had stalin doubted his reaction, he would have been categorized as an enemy of the people then and there. nonetheless, khrushchev became a candidate member of the politburo on january and a full member in march . in late , stalin appointed khrushchev as head of the communist party in ukraine, and khrushchev duly left moscow for kiev, again the ukrainian capital, in january . ukraine had been the site of extensive purges, with the murdered including professors in stalino whom khrushchev greatly respected. the high ranks of the party were not immune; the central committee of ukraine was so devastated that it could not convene a quorum. after khrushchev s arrival, the pace of arrests accelerated. all but one member of the ukrainian politburo organizational bureau and secretariat were arrested. almost all government officials and red army commanders were replaced. during the first few months after khrushchev s arrival, almost everyone arrested received the death penalty. biographer william taubman suggested that because khrushchev was again unsuccessfully denounced while in kiev, he must have known that some of the denunciations were not true and that innocent people were suffering. in , khrushchev addressed the fourteenth ukrainian party congress, saying comrades, we must unmask and relentlessly destroy all enemies of the people. but we must not allow a single honest bolshevik to be harmed. we must conduct a struggle against slanderers. world war ii edit occupation of polish territory edit when soviet troops, pursuant to the molotov–ribbentrop pact, invaded the eastern portion of poland on september , khrushchev accompanied the troops at stalin s direction. a large number of ethnic ukrainians lived in the invaded area, much of which today forms the western portion of ukraine. many inhabitants therefore initially welcomed the invasion, though they hoped that they would eventually become independent. khrushchev s role was to ensure that the occupied areas voted for union with the ussr. through a combination of propaganda, deception as to what was being voted for, and outright fraud, the soviets ensured that their new territories would elect assemblies which would unanimously petition for union with the ussr. when the new assemblies did so, their petitions were granted by the ussr supreme soviet, and western ukraine became a part of the ukrainian soviet socialist republic (ukrainian ssr) on november . clumsy actions by the soviets, such as staffing western ukrainian organizations with eastern ukrainians, and giving confiscated land to collective farms (kolkhozes) rather than to peasants, soon alienated western ukrainians, damaging khrushchev s efforts to achieve unity. war against germany edit when nazi germany invaded the ussr, in june , khrushchev was still at his post in kiev. stalin appointed him a political commissar, and khrushchev served on a number of fronts as an intermediary between the local military commanders and the political rulers in moscow. stalin used khrushchev to keep commanders on a tight leash, while the commanders sought to have him influence stalin. as the germans advanced, khrushchev worked with the military in an attempt to defend and save kiev. handicapped by orders from stalin that under no circumstances should the city be abandoned, the red army was soon encircled by the germans. while the germans stated they took , prisoners, according to the soviets, , men out of , escaped the trap. primary sources differ on khrushchev s involvement at this point. according to marshal georgi zhukov, writing some years after khrushchev fired and disgraced him in , khrushchev persuaded stalin not to evacuate troops from kiev. however, khrushchev noted in his memoirs that he and marshal semyon budyonny proposed redeploying soviet forces to avoid the encirclement until marshal semyon timoshenko arrived from moscow with orders for the troops to hold their positions. early khrushchev biographer mark frankland suggested that khrushchev s faith in his leader was first shaken by the red army s setbacks. khrushchev stated in his memoirs .mw parser

enemy breakthrough in the kiev area, the encirclement of our group, and the destruction of the th army. later, the fifth army also perished ... all of this was senseless, and from the military point of view, a display of ignorance, incompetence, and illiteracy. ... there you have the result of not taking a step backward. we were unable to save these troops because we didn t withdraw them, and as a result we simply lost them. ... and yet it was possible to allow this not to happen. in , khrushchev was on the southwest front, and he and timoshenko proposed a massive counteroffensive in the kharkov area. stalin approved only part of the plan, but , red army soldiers would still become involved in the offensive. the germans, however, had deduced that the soviets were likely to attack at kharkov, and set a trap. beginning on may , the soviet offensive initially appeared successful, but within five days the germans had driven deep into the soviet flanks, and the red army troops were in danger of being cut off. stalin refused to halt the offensive, and the red army divisions were soon encircled by the germans. the ussr lost about , soldiers, including more than , men captured, and stalin demoted timoshenko and recalled khrushchev to moscow. while stalin hinted at arresting and executing khrushchev, he allowed the commissar to return to the front by sending him to stalingrad. khrushchev (left) on the stalingrad front khrushchev reached the stalingrad front in august , soon after the start of the battle for the city. his role in the stalingrad defense was not major—general vasily chuikov, who led the city s defense, mentions khrushchev only briefly in a memoir published while khrushchev was premier—but to the end of his life, he was proud of his role. though he visited stalin in moscow on occasion, he remained in stalingrad for much of the battle, and was nearly killed at least once. he proposed a counterattack, only to find that zhukov and other generals had already planned operation uranus, a plan to break out from soviet positions and encircle and destroy the germans; it was being kept secret. before uranus was launched, khrushchev spent much time checking on troop readiness and morale, interrogating nazi prisoners, and recruiting some for propaganda purposes. soon after stalingrad, khrushchev met with personal tragedy, as his son leonid, a fighter pilot, was apparently shot down and killed in action on march . the circumstances of leonid s death remain obscure and controversial, as none of his fellow fliers stated that they witnessed him being shot down, nor was his plane found or body recovered. as a result, leonid s fate has been the subject of considerable speculation. one theory has leonid surviving the crash and collaborating with the germans, and when he was recaptured by the soviets, stalin ordering him shot despite nikita khrushchev pleading for his life. this supposed killing is used to explain why khrushchev later denounced stalin in the secret speech. while there is no supporting evidence for this account in soviet files, some historians allege that leonid khrushchev s file was tampered with after the war. in later years, leonid khrushchev s wingmate stated that he saw his plane disintegrate, but did not report it. khrushchev biographer taubman speculates that this omission was most likely to avoid the possibility of being seen as complicit in the death of the son of a politburo member. in mid , leonid s wife, liuba khrushcheva, was arrested on accusations of spying and sentenced to five years in a labor camp, and her son (by another relationship), tolya, was placed in a series of orphanages. leonid s daughter, yulia, was raised by nikita khrushchev and his wife. after uranus forced the germans into retreat, khrushchev served in other fronts of the war. he was attached to soviet troops at the battle of kursk, in july , which turned back the last major german offensive on soviet soil. khrushchev related that he interrogated an ss defector, learning that the germans intended an attack—a claim dismissed by his biographer taubman as almost certainly exaggerated . he accompanied soviet troops as they took kiev in november , entering the shattered city as soviet forces drove out german troops. as soviet forces met with greater success, driving the nazis westwards towards germany, nikita khrushchev became increasingly involved in reconstruction work in ukraine. he was appointed premier of the ukrainian ssr in addition to his earlier party post, one of the rare instances in which the ukrainian party and civil leader posts were held by one person. according to khrushchev biographer william tompson, it is difficult to assess khrushchev s war record, since he most often acted as part of a military council, and it is not possible to know the extent to which he influenced decisions, rather than signing off on the orders of military officers. however, tompson points to the fact that the few mentions of khrushchev in military memoirs published during the brezhnev era were generally favorable, at a time when it was barely possible to mention khrushchev in print in any context . tompson suggests that these favorable mentions indicate that military officers held khrushchev in high regard. rise to power edit return to ukraine edit almost all of ukraine had been occupied by the germans, and khrushchev returned to his domain in late to find devastation. ukraine s industry had been destroyed, and agriculture faced critical shortages. even though millions of ukrainians had been taken to germany as workers or prisoners of war, there was insufficient housing for those who remained. one out of every six ukrainians was killed in world war ii. khrushchev sought to reconstruct ukraine, but also desired to complete the interrupted work of imposing the soviet system on it, though he hoped that the purges of the s would not recur. as ukraine was recovered militarily, conscription was imposed, and , men aged between nineteen and fifty were given minimal military training and sent to join the red army. other ukrainians joined partisan forces, seeking an independent ukraine. khrushchev rushed from district to district through ukraine, urging the depleted labor force to greater efforts. he made a short visit to his birthplace of kalinovka, finding a starving population, with only a third of the men who had joined the red army having returned. khrushchev did what he could to assist his hometown. despite khrushchev s efforts, in , ukrainian industry was at only a quarter of pre war levels, and the harvest actually dropped from that of , when the entire territory of ukraine had not yet been retaken. in an effort to increase agricultural production, the kolkhozes (collective farms) were empowered to expel residents who were not pulling their weight. kolkhoz leaders used this as an excuse to expel their personal enemies, invalids, and the elderly, and nearly , people were sent to the eastern parts of the soviet union. khrushchev viewed this policy as very effective, and recommended its adoption elsewhere to stalin. he also worked to impose collectivization on western ukraine. while khrushchev hoped to accomplish this by , lack of resources and armed resistance by partisans slowed the process. the partisans, many of whom fought as the ukrainian insurgent army (upa), were gradually defeated, as soviet police and military reported killing , bandits and capturing a quarter million more between and . about , western ukrainians were arrested between and , with one third executed and the remainder imprisoned or exiled to the east. the war years of and had seen poor harvests, and saw intense drought strike ukraine and western russia. despite this, collective and state farms were required to turn over % of the harvest to the government. the soviet government sought to collect as much grain as possible in order to supply communist allies in eastern europe. khrushchev set the quotas at a high level, leading stalin to expect an unrealistically large quantity of grain from ukraine. food was rationed—but non agricultural rural workers throughout the ussr were given no ration cards. the inevitable starvation was largely confined to remote rural regions, and was little noticed outside the ussr. khrushchev, realizing the desperate situation in late , repeatedly appealed to stalin for aid, to be met with anger and resistance on the part of the leader. when letters to stalin had no effect, khrushchev flew to moscow and made his case in person. stalin finally gave ukraine limited food aid, and money to set up free soup kitchens. however, khrushchev s political standing had been damaged, and in february , stalin suggested that lazar kaganovich be sent to ukraine to help khrushchev. the following month, the ukrainian central committee removed khrushchev as party leader in favor of kaganovich, while retaining him as premier. soon after kaganovich arrived in kiev, khrushchev fell ill, and was barely seen until september . in his memoirs, khrushchev indicates he had pneumonia; some biographers have theorized that khrushchev s illness was entirely political, out of fear that his loss of position was the first step towards downfall and demise. however, khrushchev s children remembered their father as having been seriously ill. once khrushchev was able to get out of bed, he and his family took their first vacation since before the war, to a beachfront resort in latvia. khrushchev, though, soon broke the beach routine with duck hunting trips, and a visit to newly soviet kaliningrad, where he toured factories and quarries. by the end of , kaganovich had been recalled to moscow and the recovered khrushchev had been restored to the first secretaryship. he then resigned the ukrainian premiership in favor of demyan korotchenko, khrushchev s protégé. khrushchev s final years in ukraine were generally peaceful, with industry recovering, soviet forces overcoming the partisans, and and seeing better than expected harvests. collectivization advanced in western ukraine, and khrushchev implemented more policies that encouraged collectivization and discouraged private farms. these sometimes backfired, however a tax on private livestock holdings led to peasants slaughtering their stock. with the idea of eliminating differences in attitude between town and countryside and transforming the peasantry into a rural proletariat , khrushchev conceived the idea of the agro town . rather than agricultural workers living in villages close to farms, they would live further away in larger towns which would offer municipal services such as utilities and libraries, which were not present in villages. he completed only one such town before his december return to moscow; he dedicated it to stalin as a th birthday present. in his memoirs, khrushchev spoke highly of ukraine, where he governed for over a decade i ll say that the ukrainian people treated me well. i recall warmly the years i spent there. this was a period full of responsibilities, but pleasant because it brought satisfaction ... but far be it from me to inflate my significance. the entire ukrainian people was exerting great efforts ... i attribute ukraine s successes to the ukrainian people as a whole. i won t elaborate further on this theme, but in principle it s very easy to demonstrate. i m russian myself, and i don t want to offend the russians. stalin s final years edit khrushchev attributed his recall to moscow to mental disorder on the part of stalin, who feared conspiracies in moscow matching those which the ruler believed to have occurred in the fabricated leningrad case, in which many of that city s party officials had been falsely accused of treason. khrushchev again served as head of the party in moscow city and province. khrushchev biographer taubman suggests that stalin most likely recalled khrushchev to moscow to balance the influence of georgy malenkov and security chief lavrentiy beria, who were widely seen as stalin s heirs. at this time, the aging leader rarely called politburo meetings. instead, much of the high level work of government took place at dinners hosted by stalin. these sessions, which beria, malenkov, khrushchev, kaganovich, kliment voroshilov, vyacheslav molotov, and nikolai bulganin, who comprised stalin s inner circle, attended, began with showings of cowboy movies favored by stalin. stolen from the west, they lacked subtitles. the dictator had the meal served at around a.m., and insisted that his subordinates stay with him and drink until dawn. on one occasion, stalin had khrushchev, then aged almost sixty, dance a traditional ukrainian dance. khrushchev did so, later stating, when stalin says dance, a wise man dances. khrushchev attempted to nap at lunch so that he would not fall asleep in stalin s presence; he noted in his memoirs, things went badly for those who dozed off at stalin s table. in , khrushchev began a large scale housing program for moscow. a large part of the housing was in the form of five or six story apartment buildings, which became ubiquitous throughout the soviet union; many remain in use today. khrushchev had prefabricated reinforced concrete used, greatly speeding up construction. these structures were completed at triple the construction rate of moscow housing from – , lacked elevators or balconies, and were nicknamed khrushchyovka by the public, but because of their shoddy workmanship sometimes disparagingly called khrushchoba as a portmanteau combining khrushchev s name with the russian word trushchoba, meaning slum . in , almost , , residents of the former soviet union still lived in these buildings. in his new positions, khrushchev continued his kolkhoz consolidation scheme, which decreased the number of collective farms in moscow province by about %. this resulted in farms that were too large for one chairman to manage effectively. khrushchev also sought to implement his agro town proposal, but when his lengthy speech on the subject was published in pravda in march , stalin disapproved of it. the periodical quickly published a note stating that khrushchev s speech was merely a proposal, not policy. in april, the politburo disavowed the agro town proposal. khrushchev feared that stalin would remove him from office, but the leader mocked khrushchev, then allowed the episode to pass. on march , stalin suffered a massive stroke, apparently on rising after sleep. stalin had left orders not to be disturbed, and it was twelve hours until his condition was discovered. even as terrified doctors attempted treatment, khrushchev and his colleagues engaged in intense discussion as to the new government. on march, stalin died. as khrushchev and other high officials stood weeping by stalin s bedside, beria raced from the room, shouting for his car. khrushchev reflected on stalin in his memoirs stalin called everyone who didn t agree with him an enemy of the people. he said that they wanted to restore the old order, and for this purpose, the enemies of the people had linked up with the forces of reaction internationally. as a result, several hundred thousand honest people perished. everyone lived in fear in those days. everyone expected that at any moment there would be a knock on the door in the middle of the night and that knock on the door would prove fatal ... p eople not to stalin s liking were annihilated, honest party members, irreproachable people, loyal and hard workers for our cause who had gone through the school of revolutionary struggle under lenin s leadership. this was utter and complete arbitrariness. and now is all this to be forgiven and forgotten? never! struggle for control edit on march , stalin s death was announced, as was the new leadership. malenkov was the new chairman of the council of ministers, with beria (who consolidated his hold over the security agencies), kaganovich, bulganin, and former foreign minister vyacheslav molotov as first vice chairmen. stalin s funeral was conducted on march. those members of the presidium of the central committee who had been recently promoted by stalin were demoted. khrushchev was relieved of his duties as party head for moscow to concentrate on unspecified duties in the party s central committee. the new york times listed malenkov and beria first and second among the ten man presidium—and khrushchev last. however, on march, malenkov resigned from the secretariat of the central committee. this came due to concerns that he was acquiring too much power. the major beneficiary was khrushchev. his name appeared atop a revised list of secretaries—indicating that he was now in charge of the party. the central committee formally elected him first secretary in september. even before stalin had been laid to rest, beria launched a lengthy series of reforms which rivalled those of khrushchev during his period of power and even those of mikhail gorbachev a third of a century later. beria s proposals were designed to denigrate stalin and pass the blame for beria s own crimes to the late leader. one proposal, which was adopted, was an amnesty which eventually led to the freeing of over a million prisoners. another, which was not adopted, was to release east germany into a united, neutral germany in exchange for compensation from the west —a proposal considered by khrushchev to be anti communist. khrushchev allied with malenkov to block many of beria s proposals, while the two slowly picked up support from other presidium members. their campaign against beria was aided by fears that beria was planning a military coup, and, according to khrushchev in his memoirs, by the conviction that beria is getting his knives ready for us. on june beria was arrested at a presidium meeting, following extensive military preparations by khrushchev and his allies. beria was tried in secret, and executed in december with five of his close associates. the execution of beria proved to be the last time the loser of a top level soviet power struggle paid with his life. the power struggle in the presidium was not resolved by the elimination of beria. malenkov s power was in the central state apparatus, which he sought to extend through reorganizing the government, giving it additional power at the expense of the party. he also sought public support by lowering retail prices and lowering the level of bond sales to citizens, which had long been effectively obligatory. khrushchev, on the other hand, with his power base in the party, sought to both strengthen the party and his position within it. while, under the soviet system, the party was to be preeminent, it had been greatly drained of power by stalin, who had given much of that power to himself and to the politburo (later, to the presidium). khrushchev saw that with the presidium in conflict, the party and its central committee might again become powerful. khrushchev carefully cultivated high party officials, and was able to appoint supporters as local party bosses, who then took seats on the central committee. khrushchev presented himself as a down to earth activist prepared to take up any challenge, contrasting with malenkov who, though sophisticated, came across as colorless. khrushchev arranged for the kremlin grounds to be opened to the public, an act with great public resonance . while both malenkov and khrushchev sought reforms to agriculture, khrushchev s proposals were broader, and included the virgin lands campaign, under which hundreds of thousands of young volunteers would settle and farm areas of western siberia and northern kazakhstan. while the scheme eventually became a tremendous disaster for soviet agriculture, it was initially successful. in addition, khrushchev possessed incriminating information on malenkov, taken from beria s secret files. as soviet prosecutors investigated the atrocities of stalin s last years, including the leningrad case, they came across evidence of malenkov s involvement. beginning in february , khrushchev replaced malenkov in the seat of honor at presidium meetings; in june, malenkov ceased to head the list of presidium members, which was thereafter organized in alphabetical order. khrushchev s influence continued to increase, winning the allegiance of local party heads, and with his nominee heading the kgb. at a central committee meeting in january , malenkov was accused of involvement in atrocities, and the committee passed a resolution accusing him of involvement in the leningrad case, and of facilitating beria s climb to power. at a meeting of the mostly ceremonial supreme soviet the following month, malenkov was demoted in favor of bulganin, to the surprise of western observers. malenkov remained in the presidium as minister of electric power stations. according to khrushchev biographer william tompson, khrushchev s position as first among the members of the collective leadership was now beyond any reasonable doubt. leader ( – ) edit domestic policies edit consolidation of power; secret speech edit main article secret speech after the demotion of malenkov, khrushchev and molotov initially worked together well, and the longtime foreign minister even proposed that khrushchev, not bulganin, replace malenkov as premier. however, khrushchev and molotov increasingly differed on policy. molotov opposed the virgin lands policy, instead proposing heavy investment to increase yields in developed agricultural areas, which khrushchev felt was not feasible due to a lack of resources and a lack of a sophisticated farm labor force. the two differed on foreign policy as well; soon after khrushchev took power, he sought a peace treaty with austria, which would allow soviet troops then in occupation of part of the country to leave. molotov was resistant, but khrushchev arranged for an austrian delegation to come to moscow and negotiate the treaty. although khrushchev and other presidium members attacked molotov at a central committee meeting in mid , accusing him of conducting a foreign policy which turned the world against the ussr, molotov remained in his position. by the end of , thousands of political prisoners had returned home, and told their experiences of the gulag labor camps. continuing investigation into the abuses brought home the full breadth of stalin s crimes to his successors. khrushchev believed that once the stain of stalinism was removed, the party would inspire loyalty among the people. beginning in october , khrushchev fought to tell the delegates to the upcoming th party congress about stalin s crimes. some of his colleagues, including molotov and malenkov, opposed the disclosure, and managed to persuade him to make his remarks in a closed session. the th party congress opened on february . in his opening words in his initial address, khrushchev denigrated stalin by asking delegates to rise in honor of the communist leaders who had died since the last congress, whom he named, equating stalin with klement gottwald and the little known kyuichi tokuda. in the early morning hours of february, khrushchev delivered what became known as the secret speech to a closed session of the congress limited to soviet delegates. in four hours, he demolished stalin s reputation. khrushchev noted in his memoirs that the congress listened to me in silence. as the saying goes, you could have heard a pin drop. it was all so sudden and unexpected. khrushchev told the delegates it is here that stalin showed in a whole series of cases his intolerance, his brutality, and his abuse of power ... he often chose the path of repression and physical annihilation, not only against actual enemies, but also against individuals who had not committed any crimes against the party or the soviet government. the secret speech, while it did not fundamentally change soviet society, had wide ranging effects. the speech was a factor in unrest in poland and revolution in hungary later in , and stalin defenders led four days of rioting in his native georgia in june, calling for khrushchev to resign and molotov to take over. in meetings where the secret speech was read, communists would make even more severe condemnations of stalin (and of khrushchev), and even call for multi party elections. however, stalin was not publicly denounced, and his portrait remained widespread through the ussr, from airports to khrushchev s kremlin office. mikhail gorbachev, then a komsomol official, recalled that though young and well educated soviets in his district were excited by the speech, many others decried it, either defending stalin or seeing little point in digging up the past. forty years later, after the fall of the soviet union, gorbachev applauded khrushchev for his courage in taking a huge political risk and showing himself to be a moral man after all . the term secret speech proved to be an utter misnomer. while the attendees at the speech were all soviet, eastern european delegates were allowed to hear it the following night, read slowly to allow them to take notes. by march, copies were being mailed throughout the soviet union, marked not for the press rather than top secret . an official translation appeared within a month in poland; the poles printed , extra copies, one of which soon reached the west. khrushchev s son, sergei, later wrote, c learly, father tried to ensure it would reach as many ears as possible. it was soon read at komsomol meetings; that meant another eighteen million listeners. if you include their relatives, friends, and acquaintances, you could say that the entire country became familiar with the speech ... spring had barely begun when the speech began circulating around the world. the anti khrushchev minority in the presidium was augmented by those opposed to khrushchev s proposals to decentralize authority over industry, which struck at the heart of malenkov s power base. during the first half of , malenkov, molotov, and kaganovich worked to quietly build support to dismiss khrushchev. at an june presidium meeting at which two khrushchev supporters were absent, the plotters moved that bulganin, who had joined the scheme, take the chair, and proposed other moves which would effectively demote khrushchev and put themselves in control. khrushchev objected on the grounds that not all presidium members had been notified, an objection which would have been quickly dismissed had khrushchev not held firm control over the military, through minister of defense marshal zhukov, and the security departments. lengthy presidium meetings took place, continuing over several days. as word leaked of the power struggle, members of the central committee, which khrushchev controlled, streamed to moscow, many flown there aboard military planes, and demanded to be admitted to the meeting. while they were not admitted, there were soon enough central committee members in moscow to call an emergency party congress, which effectively forced the leadership to allow a session of the central committee. at that meeting, the three main conspirators were dubbed the anti party group, accused of factionalism and complicity in stalin s crimes. the three were expelled from the central committee and presidium, as was former foreign minister and khrushchev client dmitri shepilov who joined them in the plot. molotov was sent as ambassador to mongolia; the others were sent to head industrial facilities and institutes far from moscow. marshal zhukov was rewarded for his support with full membership in the presidium, but khrushchev feared his popularity and power. in october, the defense minister was sent on a tour of the balkans, as khrushchev arranged a presidium meeting to dismiss him. zhukov learned what was happening, and hurried back to moscow, only to be formally notified of his dismissal. at a central committee meeting several weeks later, not a word was said in zhukov s defense. khrushchev completed the consolidation of power by arranging for bulganin s dismissal as premier in favor of himself (bulganin was appointed to head the gosbank) and by establishing a ussr defense council, led by himself, effectively making him commander in chief. though khrushchev was now preeminent, he did not enjoy stalin s absolute power. liberalization and the arts edit main article khrushchev thaw nina khrushcheva, mamie eisenhower, khrushchev, and dwight eisenhower at a state dinner in after assuming power, khrushchev allowed a modest amount of freedom in the arts. vladimir dudintsev s not by bread alone, about an idealistic engineer opposed by rigid bureaucrats, was allowed to be published in , though khrushchev called the novel false at its base . in , however, khrushchev ordered a fierce attack on boris pasternak after his novel doctor zhivago was published abroad (he was denied permission to publish it in the soviet union). pravda described the novel as low grade reactionary hackwork , and the author was expelled from the writer s union. to make things worse (from khrushchev s perspective), pasternak was awarded the nobel prize for literature, which, under heavy pressure, he declined. once he did so, khrushchev ordered a halt to the attacks on pasternak. in his memoirs, khrushchev stated that he agonized over the novel, very nearly allowed it to be published, and later regretted not doing so. after his fall from power, khrushchev obtained a copy of the novel and read it (he had earlier read only excerpts) and stated, we shouldn t have banned it. i should have read it myself. there s nothing anti soviet in it. khrushchev believed that the ussr could match the west s living standards, and was not afraid to allow soviet citizens to see western achievements. stalin had permitted few tourists to the soviet union, and had allowed few soviets to travel. khrushchev let soviets travel (over , soviet citizens travelled abroad in ) and allowed foreigners to visit the soviet union, where tourists became subjects of immense curiosity. in , khrushchev authorized the th world festival of youth and students to be held in moscow that summer. he instructed komsomol officials to smother foreign guests in our embrace . the resulting socialist carnival involved over three million moscovites, who joined with , young foreign visitors in events that ranged from discussion groups throughout the city to events at the kremlin itself. according to historian vladislav zubok, the festival shattered propagandist clichés about westerners by allowing moscovites to see them for themselves. in , khrushchev, impressed by aleksandr solzhenitsyn s one day in the life of ivan denisovich, persuaded the presidium to allow publication. that renewed thaw ended on december , when khrushchev was taken to the manezh gallery to view an exhibit which included a number of avant garde works. on seeing them, khrushchev exploded with anger, an episode known as the manege affair, describing the artwork as dog shit , and proclaiming that a donkey could smear better art with its tail . a week later, pravda issued a call for artistic purity. when writers and filmmakers defended the painters, khrushchev extended his anger to them. however, despite the premier s rage, none of the artists were arrested or exiled. the manezh gallery exhibit remained open for some time after khrushchev s visit, and experienced a considerable rise in attendance after the article in pravda. political reform edit under khrushchev, the special tribunals operated by security agencies were abolished. these tribunals (known as troikas), had often ignored laws and procedures. under the reforms, no prosecution for a political crime could be brought even in the regular courts unless approved by the local party committee. this rarely happened; there were no major political trials under khrushchev, and at most several hundred political prosecutions overall. instead, other sanctions were imposed on soviet dissidents, including loss of job or university position, or expulsion from the party. during khrushchev s rule, forced hospitalization for the socially dangerous was introduced. according to author roy medvedev, who wrote an early analysis of khrushchev s years in power, political terror as an everyday method of government was replaced under khrushchev by administrative means of repression . nikita khrushchev, time magazine s man of the year for in , khrushchev opened a central committee meeting to hundreds of soviet officials; some were even allowed to address the meeting. for the first time, the proceedings of the committee were made public in book form, a practice which was continued at subsequent meetings. this openness, however, actually allowed khrushchev greater control over the committee, since any dissenters would have to make their case in front of a large, disapproving crowd. in , khrushchev divided oblast level party committees (obkoms) into two parallel structures, one for industry and one for agriculture. this was unpopular among party apparatchiks, and led to confusions in the chain of command, as neither committee secretary had precedence over the other. as there were limited numbers of central committee seats from each oblast, the division set up the possibility of rivalry for office between factions, and, according to medvedev, had the potential for beginning a two party system. khrushchev also ordered that one third of the membership of each committee, from low level councils to the central committee itself, be replaced at each election. this decree created tension between khrushchev and the central committee, and upset the party leaders upon whose support khrushchev had risen to power. agricultural policy edit since the s, khrushchev had advocated the cultivation of corn (maize) in the soviet union. he established a corn institute in ukraine and ordered thousands of acres to be planted with corn in the virgin lands. in february , khrushchev gave a speech in which he advocated an iowa style corn belt in the soviet union, and a soviet delegation visited the u.s. state that summer. while their intent was to visit only small farms, the delegation chief was approached by farmer and corn salesman roswell garst, who persuaded him to insist on visiting garst s large farm. the iowan visited the soviet union in september, where he became great friends with khrushchev, and garst sold the ussr , short tons ( , t) of seed corn. garst warned the soviets to grow the corn in the southern part of the country, and to ensure there were sufficient stocks of fertilizer, insecticides, and herbicides. this, however, was not done, as khrushchev sought to plant corn even in siberia, and without the necessary chemicals. while khrushchev warned against those who would have us plant the whole planet with corn , he displayed a great passion for corn, so much so that when he visited a latvian kolkhoz, he stated that some in his audience were probably wondering, will khrushchev say something about corn or won t he? he did, rebuking the farmers for not planting more corn. the corn experiment was not a great success, and he later wrote that overenthusiastic officials, wanting to please him, had overplanted without laying the proper groundwork, and as a result corn was discredited as a silage crop—and so was i . khrushchev sought to abolish the machine tractor stations (mts) which not only owned most large agricultural machines such as combines and tractors, but also provided services such as plowing, and transfer their equipment and functions to the kolkhozes and sovkhozes (state farms). after a successful test involving mts which served one large kolkhoz each, khrushchev ordered a gradual transition—but then ordered that the change take place with great speed. within three months, over half of the mts facilities had been closed, and kolkhozes were being required to buy the equipment, with no discount given for older or dilapidated machines. mts employees, unwilling to bind themselves to kolkhozes and lose their state employee benefits and the right to change their jobs, fled to the cities, creating a shortage of skilled operators. the costs of the machinery, plus the costs of building storage sheds and fuel tanks for the equipment, impoverished many kolkhozes. inadequate provisions were made for repair stations. without the mts, the market for soviet agricultural equipment fell apart, as the kolkhozes now had neither the money nor skilled buyers to purchase new equipment. one adviser to khrushchev was trofim lysenko, who promised greatly increased production with minimal investment. such schemes were attractive to khrushchev, who ordered them implemented. lysenko managed to maintain his influence under khrushchev despite repeated failures; as each proposal failed, he advocated another. lysenko s influence greatly retarded the development of genetic science in the soviet union. in , khrushchev announced a goal of overtaking the united states in production of milk, meat, and butter. local officials, with khrushchev s encouragement, made unrealistic pledges of production. these goals were met by forcing farmers to slaughter their breeding herds and by purchasing meat at state stores, then reselling it back to the government, artificially increasing recorded production. in june , food prices were raised, particularly on meat and butter (by – %). this caused public discontent. in the southern russian city of novocherkassk (rostov region), this discontent escalated to a strike and a revolt against the authorities. the revolt was put down by the military. according to soviet official accounts, people were killed and wounded. in addition, demonstrators were convicted of involvement and seven of them executed. information about the revolt was completely suppressed in the ussr, but spread through samizdat and damaged khrushchev s reputation in the west. drought struck the soviet union in ; the harvest of , , short tons ( , , t) of grain was down from a peak of , , short tons ( , , t) in . the shortages resulted in bread lines, a fact at first kept from khrushchev. reluctant to purchase food in the west, but faced with the alternative of widespread hunger, khrushchev exhausted the nation s hard currency reserves and expended part of its gold stockpile in the purchase of grain and other foodstuffs. education edit khrushchev (right) with cosmonauts yuri gagarin, pavel popovich and valentina tereshkova, while visiting the united states in , khrushchev was greatly impressed by the agricultural education program at iowa state university, and sought to imitate it in the soviet union. at the time, the main agricultural college in the ussr was in moscow, and students did not do the manual labor of farming. khrushchev proposed to move the programs to rural areas. he was unsuccessful, due to resistance from professors and students, who never actually disagreed with the premier, but who did not carry out his proposals. khrushchev recalled in his memoirs, it s nice to live in moscow and work at the timiryazev agricultural academy. it s a venerable old institution, a large economic unit, with skilled instructors, but it s in the city! its students aren t yearning to work on the collective farms because to do that they d have to go out in the provinces and live in the sticks. khrushchev founded several academic towns, such as akademgorodok. the premier believed that western science flourished because many scientists lived in university towns such as oxford, isolated from big city distractions, and had pleasant living conditions and good pay. he sought to duplicate those conditions in the soviet union. khrushchev s attempt was generally successful, though his new towns and scientific centers tended to attract younger scientists, with older ones unwilling to leave moscow or leningrad. khrushchev also proposed to restructure soviet high schools. while the high schools provided a college preparatory curriculum, in fact few soviet youths went on to university. khrushchev wanted to shift the focus of secondary schools to vocational training students would spend much of their time at factory jobs or in apprenticeships and only a small part at the schools. in practice, what occurred is that schools developed links with nearby enterprises, and students went to work for only one or two days a week; the factories and other works disliked having to teach, while students and their families complained that they had little choice in what trade to learn. while the vocational proposal would not survive khrushchev s downfall, a longer lasting change was a related establishment of specialized high schools for gifted students or those wishing to study a specific subject. these schools were modeled after the foreign language schools that had been established in moscow and leningrad beginning in . in , a special summer school was established in novosibirsk to prepare students for a siberian math and science olympiad. the following year, the novosibirsk maths and science boarding school became the first permanent residential school specializing in math and science. other such schools were soon established in moscow, leningrad, and kiev. by the early s, over specialized schools had been established, in mathematics, the sciences, art, music, and sport. preschool education was increased as part of khrushchev s reforms, and by the time he left office, about % of soviet children attended preschool—about half of urban children, but only about % of rural children. religion edit the anti religious campaign of the khrushchev era began in , coinciding with the st party congress in the same year. it was carried out by mass closures of churches (reducing the number from , in to , in and to , by ), monasteries, and convents, as well as of the still existing seminaries (pastoral courses would be banned in general). the campaign also included a restriction of parental rights for teaching religion to their children, a ban on the presence of children at church services (beginning in with the baptists and then extended to the orthodox in ), and a ban on administration of the eucharist to children over the age of four. khrushchev additionally banned all services held outside of church walls, renewed enforcement of the legislation banning pilgrimages, and recorded the personal identities of all adults requesting church baptisms, weddings or funerals. he also disallowed the ringing of church bells and services in daytime in some rural settings from may to the end of october under the pretext of field work requirements. non fulfillment of these regulations by clergy would lead to disallowance of state registration for them (which meant they could no longer do any pastoral work or liturgy at all, without special state permission). according to dimitry pospielovsky, the state carried out forced retirement, arrests and prison sentences on clergymen for trumped up charges , but he writes that it was in reality for resisting the closure of churches and for giving sermons attacking atheism or the anti religious campaign, or who conducted christian charity or who made religion popular by personal example. foreign and defense policies edit khrushchev (rowing the boat) with the swedish prime minister tage erlander, when khrushchev took control, the outside world still knew little of him, and initially was not impressed by him. short, heavyset, and wearing ill fitting suits, he radiated energy but not intellect , and was dismissed by many as a buffoon who would not last long. british foreign secretary harold macmillan wondered, how can this fat, vulgar man with his pig eyes and ceaseless flow of talk be the head—the aspirant tsar for all those millions of people? khrushchev biographer tompson described the mercurial leader he could be charming or vulgar, ebullient or sullen, he was given to public displays of rage (often contrived) and to soaring hyperbole in his rhetoric. but whatever he was, however he came across, he was more human than his predecessor or even than most of his foreign counterparts, and for much of the world that was enough to make the ussr seem less mysterious or menacing. united states and allies edit early relations and u.s. visit ( – ) edit khrushchev (right) with u.s. vice president richard nixon, khrushchev with agriculture secretary ezra taft benson (left of khrushchev) and u.s. ambassador to the united nations henry cabot lodge (far left) during his visit on september to the agricultural research service center khrushchev sought to find a lasting solution to the problem of a divided germany and of the enclave of west berlin deep within east german territory. in november , calling west berlin a malignant tumor , he gave the united states, united kingdom and france six months to conclude a peace treaty with both german states and the soviet union. if one was not signed, khrushchev stated, the soviet union would conclude a peace treaty with east germany. this would leave east germany, which was not a party to treaties giving the western powers access to berlin, in control of the routes to the city. this ultimatum caused dissent among the western allies, who were reluctant to go to war over the issue. khrushchev, however, repeatedly extended the deadline. khrushchev sought to eliminate many conventional weapons, and defend the soviet union with missiles. he believed that unless this occurred, the huge soviet military would continue to eat up resources, making khrushchev s goals of improving soviet life difficult to achieve. in , khrushchev abandoned stalin s plans for a large navy, believing that the new ships would be too vulnerable to either conventional or nuclear attack. in january , khrushchev took advantage of improved relations with the u.s. to order a reduction of one third in the size of soviet armed forces, alleging that advanced weapons would make up for the lost troops. while conscription of soviet youth remained in force, exemptions from military service became more and more common, especially for students. the soviets had few operable icbms; in spite of this, khrushchev publicly boasted of the soviets missile programs, stating that soviet weapons were varied and numerous. the first secretary hoped that public perception that the soviets were ahead would result in psychological pressure on the west and political concessions. the soviet space program, which khrushchev firmly supported, appeared to confirm his claims when the soviets launched sputnik into orbit, a launch many westerners, including united states vice president richard nixon were convinced was a hoax. when it became clear that the launch was real, and sputnik was in orbit, western governments concluded that the soviet icbm program was further along than it actually was. khrushchev added to this misapprehension by stating in an october interview that the ussr had all the rockets, of whatever capacity, that it needed. for years, khrushchev would make a point of preceding a major foreign trip with a rocket launch, to the discomfiture of his hosts. the united states learned of the primitive state of the soviet missile program from overflights in the late s, but only high u.s. officials knew of the deception. in january , khrushchev told the presidium that soviet icbms made an agreement with the u.s. possible because main street americans have begun to shake from fear for the first times in their lives . the perceived missile gap led to a considerable defense buildup on the part of the united states. during nixon s visit to the soviet union in , khrushchev took part in what later became known as the kitchen debate. nixon and khrushchev had an impassioned argument in a model kitchen at the american national exhibition in moscow, with each defending the economic system of his country. khrushchev was invited to visit the united states, and did so that september, spending thirteen days. khrushchev arrived in washington, dc on his first visit to the united states on september . the first visit by a soviet premier to the united states resulted in an extended media circus. khrushchev brought his wife, nina petrovna, and adult children with him, though it was not usual for soviet officials to travel with their families. the peripatetic premier visited new york city, los angeles, san francisco (visiting a supermarket), coon rapids, iowa (visiting roswell garst s farm), pittsburgh, and washington, concluding with a meeting with u.s. president eisenhower at camp david. during luncheon at the twentieth century fox studio in los angeles khrushchev engaged in an improvised yet jovial debate with his host spyros skouras over the respective merits of capitalism and communism. khrushchev was supposed to visit disneyland, but the visit was canceled for security reasons, much to his disgruntlement. he did, however, visit eleanor roosevelt at her home in hyde park, new york. while visiting ibm s new research campus in san jose, california, khrushchev expressed little interest in computer technology, but he greatly admired the self service cafeteria, and, on his return, introduced self service in the soviet union. khrushchev s u.s. visit resulted in an informal agreement with u.s. president dwight eisenhower that there would be no firm deadline over berlin, but that there would be a four power summit to try to resolve the issue, and the premier left the u.s. to general good feelings. khrushchev returned from the u.s. convinced that he had achieved a strong personal relationship with eisenhower (who in fact was unimpressed by the soviet leader) and that he could achieve détente with the americans. he pushed for an immediate summit, but was frustrated by french president charles de gaulle, who postponed it until , a year in which eisenhower was scheduled to pay a return visit to the soviet union. u and berlin crisis ( – ) edit khrushchev and head of ussr delegation zoya mironova at the united nations, september a constant irritant in soviet–u.s. relations was the overflight of the soviet union by american u spy aircraft. on april , the u.s. resumed such flights after a lengthy break. the soviets had protested the flights in the past, but had been ignored by washington. content in what he thought was a strong personal relationship with eisenhower, khrushchev was confused and angered by the flights resumption, and concluded that they had been ordered by cia director allen dulles without the u.s. president s knowledge. on may, a u was shot down, its pilot, francis gary powers, captured alive. believing powers to have been killed, the u.s. announced that a weather plane had been lost near the turkish soviet border. khrushchev risked destroying the summit, due to start on may in paris, if he announced the shootdown, but would look weak in the eyes of his military and security forces if he did nothing. finally, on may, khrushchev announced the shootdown and powers capture, blaming the overflight on imperialist circles and militarists, whose stronghold is the pentagon , and suggesting the plane had been sent without eisenhower s knowledge. eisenhower could not have it thought that there were rogue elements in the pentagon operating without his knowledge, and admitted that he had ordered the flights, calling them a distasteful necessity . the admission stunned khrushchev, and turned the u affair from a possible triumph to a disaster for him, and he even appealed to u.s. ambassador llewellyn thompson for help. khrushchev was undecided what to do at the summit even as he boarded his flight to paris. he finally decided, in consultation with his advisers on the plane and presidium members in moscow, to demand an apology from eisenhower and a promise that there would be no further u flights in soviet airspace. neither eisenhower nor khrushchev communicated with the other in the days before the summit, and at the summit, khrushchev made his demands and stated that there was no purpose in the summit, which should be postponed for six to eight months, that is until after the united states presidential election. the u.s. president offered no apology, but stated that the flights had been suspended and would not resume, and renewed his open skies proposal for mutual overflight rights. this was not enough for khrushchev, who left the summit. eisenhower accused khrushchev of sabotaging this meeting, on which so much of the hopes of the world have rested . eisenhower s visit to the soviet union, for which the premier had even built a golf course so the u.s. president could enjoy his favorite sport, was canceled by khrushchev. khrushchev made his second and final visit to the united states in september . he had no invitation, but had appointed himself as head of the ussr s un delegation. he spent much of his time wooing the new third world states which had recently become independent. the u.s. restricted him to the island of manhattan, with visits to an estate owned by the ussr on long island. the notorious shoe banging incident occurred during a debate on october over a soviet resolution decrying colonialism. khrushchev was infuriated by a statement of the filipino delegate lorenzo sumulong charging the soviets with employing a double standard by decrying colonialism while dominating eastern europe. khrushchev demanded the right to reply immediately and accused sumulong of being a fawning lackey of the american imperialists . sumulong resumed his speech and accused the soviets of hypocrisy. khrushchev yanked off his shoe and began banging it on his desk. this behavior by khrushchev scandalized his delegation. khrushchev and john f. kennedy, vienna, june khrushchev considered u.s. vice president nixon a hardliner, and was delighted by his defeat in the presidential election. he considered the victor, massachusetts senator john f. kennedy, as a far more likely partner for détente, but was taken aback by the newly inaugurated u.s. president s tough talk and actions in the early days of his administration. khrushchev achieved a propaganda victory in april with the first manned spaceflight, while kennedy suffered a defeat with the failure of the bay of pigs invasion. while khrushchev had threatened to defend cuba with soviet missiles, the premier contented himself with after the fact aggressive remarks. the failure in cuba led to kennedy s determination to make no concessions at the vienna summit scheduled for june . both kennedy and khrushchev took a hard line, with khrushchev demanding a treaty that would recognize the two german states and refusing to yield on the remaining issues obstructing a test ban treaty. kennedy, on the other hand, had been led to believe that the test ban treaty could be concluded at the summit, and felt that a deal on berlin had to await easing of east–west tensions. kennedy described negotiating with khrushchev to his brother robert as like dealing with dad. all give and no take. the maximum territorial extent of countries in the world under soviet influence, after the cuban revolution of and before the official sino soviet split of an indefinite postponement of action over berlin was unacceptable to khrushchev, if for no other reason than that east germany was suffering a continuous brain drain as highly educated east germans fled west through berlin. while the boundary between the two german states had elsewhere been fortified, berlin, administered by the four allied powers, remained open. emboldened by statements from former u.s. ambassador to moscow charles e. bohlen and united states senate committee on foreign relations chairman j. william fulbright that east germany had every right to close its borders, which were not disavowed by the kennedy administration, khrushchev authorized east german leader walter ulbricht to begin construction of what became known as the berlin wall, which would surround west berlin. construction preparations were made in great secrecy, and the border was sealed off in the early hours of sunday, august , when most east german workers who earned hard currency by working in west berlin would be at their homes. the wall was a propaganda disaster, and marked the end of khrushchev s attempts to conclude a peace treaty among the four powers and the two german states. that treaty would not be signed until september , as an immediate prelude to german reunification. establishing relations with cuba edit diplomatic relations between the soviet union and cuba were officially restored in may . alexandr alexeyev was named soviet ambassador to cuba two years later, in may . cuban missile crisis and the test ban treaty ( – ) edit superpower tensions culminated in the cuban missile crisis (in the ussr, the caribbean crisis ) of october , as the soviet union sought to install medium range nuclear missiles in cuba, about miles ( km) from the u.s. coast. cuban prime minister fidel castro was reluctant to accept the missiles, and, once he was persuaded, warned khrushchev against transporting the missiles in secret. castro stated, thirty years later, we had a sovereign right to accept the missiles. we were not violating international law. why do it secretly—as if we had no right to do it? i warned nikita that secrecy would give the imperialists the advantage. on october, kennedy was informed that u flights over cuba had discovered what were most likely medium range missile sites, and though he and his advisors considered approaching khrushchev through diplomatic channels, could come up with no way of doing this that would not appear weak. on october, kennedy addressed his nation by television, revealing the missiles presence and announcing a blockade of cuba. informed in advance of the speech but not (until one hour before) the content, khrushchev and his advisors feared an invasion of cuba. even before kennedy s speech, they ordered soviet commanders in cuba that they could use all weapons against an attack—except atomic weapons. as the crisis unfolded, tensions were high in the u.s.; less so in the soviet union, where khrushchev made several public appearances, and went to the bolshoi theatre to hear american opera singer jerome hines, who was then performing in moscow. by october, with the soviets unclear about kennedy s full intentions, khrushchev decided that the missiles would have to be withdrawn from cuba. two days later, he offered kennedy terms for the withdrawal. khrushchev agreed to withdraw the missiles in exchange for a u.s. promise not to invade cuba and a secret promise that the u.s. would withdraw missiles from turkey, near the soviet heartland. as the last term was not publicly announced at the request of the u.s., and was not known until just before khrushchev s death in , the resolution was seen as a great defeat for the soviets, and contributed to khrushchev s fall less than two years later. castro had urged khrushchev to launch a preemptive nuclear attack on the u.s. in the event of any invasion of cuba, and was angered by the outcome, referring to khrushchev in profane terms. after the crisis, superpower relations improved, as kennedy gave a conciliatory speech at american university on june , recognizing the soviet people s suffering during world war ii, and paying tribute to their achievements. khrushchev called the speech the best by a u.s. president since franklin roosevelt, and, in july, negotiated a test ban treaty with u.s. negotiator averell harriman and with lord hailsham of the united kingdom. plans for a second khrushchev kennedy summit were dashed by the u.s. president s assassination in november . the new u.s. president, lyndon johnson, hoped for continued improved relations but was distracted by other issues and had little opportunity to develop a relationship with khrushchev before the premier was ousted. eastern europe edit gheorghe gheorghiu dej and khrushchev at bucharest s băneasa airport in june . nicolae ceauşescu can be seen at gheorghiu dej s right hand side. khrushchev (left) and east german leader walter ulbricht, khrushchev (holding the teddy bear) on his visit to east germany with nikolai podgorny (clapping his hands) the secret speech, combined with the death of polish communist leader bolesław bierut, who suffered a heart attack while reading the speech, sparked considerable liberalization in poland and hungary. in poland, a worker s strike in poznań developed into disturbances which left more than dead in october . when moscow blamed the disturbances on western agitators, polish leaders ignored the claim, and instead made concessions to the workers. with anti soviet displays becoming more common in poland, and crucial polish leadership elections upcoming, khrushchev and other presidium members flew to warsaw. while the soviets were refused entry to the polish central committee plenum where the election was taking place, they met with the polish presidium. the soviets agreed to allow the new polish leadership to take office, on the assurance there would be no change to the soviet polish relationship. the polish settlement emboldened the hungarians, who decided that moscow could be defied. a mass demonstration in budapest on october turned into a popular uprising. in response to the uprising, hungarian party leaders installed reformist premier imre nagy. soviet forces in the city clashed with hungarians and even fired on demonstrators, with hundreds of both hungarians and soviets killed. nagy called for a cease fire and a withdrawal of soviet troops, which a khrushchev led majority in the presidium decided to obey, choosing to give the new hungarian government a chance. khrushchev assumed that if moscow announced liberalization in how it dealt with its allies, nagy would adhere to the alliance with the soviet union. however, on october nagy announced multiparty elections, and the next morning that hungary would leave the warsaw pact. on november, two members of the nagy government appeared in ukraine as the self proclaimed heads of a provisional government and demanded soviet intervention, which was forthcoming. the next day, soviet troops crushed the hungarian uprising, with a death toll of , hungarians and several hundred soviet troops. nagy was arrested, and was later executed. despite the international outrage over the intervention, khrushchev defended his actions for the rest of his life. damage to soviet foreign relations was severe, and would have been greater were it not for the fortuitous timing of the suez crisis, which distracted world attention. in the aftermath of these crises, khrushchev made the statement for which he became well remembered, we will bury you (in russian, мы вас похороним! (my vas pokhoronim!)). while many in the west took this statement as a literal threat, khrushchev made the statement in a speech on peaceful coexistence with the west. when questioned about the statement during his u.s. visit, khrushchev stated that he was not referring to a literal burial, but that, through inexorable historical development, communism would replace capitalism and bury it. khrushchev greatly improved relations with yugoslavia, which had been entirely sundered in when stalin realized he could not control yugoslav leader josip tito. khrushchev led a soviet delegation to belgrade in . though a hostile tito did everything he could to make the soviets look foolish (including getting them drunk in public), khrushchev was successful in warming relations, ending the informbiro period in soviet yugoslav relations. during the hungarian crisis, tito initially supported nagy, but khrushchev persuaded him of the need for intervention. still, the intervention in hungary damaged moscow s relationship with belgrade, which khrushchev spent several years trying to repair. he was hampered by the fact that china disapproved of yugoslavia s liberal version of communism, and attempts to conciliate belgrade resulted in an angry beijing. china edit khrushchev with mao zedong, after completing his takeover of mainland china in , mao zedong sought material assistance from the ussr, and also called for the return to china of territories taken from it under the tsars. as khrushchev took control of the ussr, he increased aid to china, even sending a small corps of experts to help develop the newly communist country. this assistance was described by historian william c. kirby as the greatest transfer of technology in world history . the soviet union spent % of its national income between and on aid to china. on his visit to china, khrushchev agreed to return port arthur and dalian to china, though khrushchev was annoyed by mao s insistence that the soviets leave their artillery as they departed. mao bitterly opposed khrushchev s attempts to reach a rapprochement with more liberal eastern european states such as yugoslavia. khrushchev s government, on the other hand, was reluctant to endorse mao s desires for an assertive worldwide revolutionary movement, preferring to conquer capitalism through raising the standard of living in communist bloc countries. relations between the two nations began to cool in , with mao angered both by the secret speech and by the fact that the chinese had not been consulted in advance about it. mao believed that de stalinization was a mistake, and a possible threat to his own authority. when khrushchev visited beijing in , mao refused proposals for military cooperation. hoping to torpedo khrushchev s efforts at détente with the u.s., mao soon thereafter provoked the second taiwan strait crisis, describing the taiwanese islands shelled in the crisis as batons that keep eisenhower and khrushchev dancing, scurrying this way and that. don t you see how wonderful they are? the soviets had planned to provide china with an atomic bomb complete with full documentation, but in , amid cooler relations, the soviets destroyed the device and papers instead. when khrushchev paid a visit to china in september, shortly after his successful u.s. visit, he met a chilly reception, and khrushchev left the country on the third day of a planned seven day visit. relations continued to deteriorate in , as both the ussr and china used a romanian communist party congress as an opportunity to attack the other. after khrushchev attacked china in his speech to the congress, chinese leader peng zhen mocked khrushchev, stating that the premier s foreign policy was to blow hot and cold towards the west. khrushchev responded by pulling soviet experts out of china. removal edit nikita khrushchev with anastas mikoyan (far right) in berlin play media universal newsreel about khrushchev s resignation beginning in march , supreme soviet presidium chairman and nominal head of state leonid brezhnev began discussing khrushchev s removal with his colleagues. while brezhnev considered having khrushchev arrested as he returned from a trip to scandinavia in june, he instead spent time persuading members of the central committee to support the ousting of khrushchev, remembering how crucial the committee s support had been to khrushchev in defeating the anti party group plot. brezhnev was given ample time for his conspiracy; khrushchev was absent from moscow for a total of five months between january and september . the conspirators, led by brezhnev, first deputy premier alexander shelepin, and kgb chairman vladimir semichastny, struck in october , while khrushchev was on vacation at pitsunda, abkhaz assr with his close ally anastas mikoyan. on october, brezhnev called khrushchev to notify him of a special presidium meeting to be held the following day, ostensibly on the subject of agriculture. even though khrushchev suspected the real reason for the meeting, he flew to moscow, accompanied by the head of the georgian kgb, general aleksi inauri, but otherwise taking no precautions. khrushchev arrived at the vip hall of vnukovo airport; kgb chairman semichastny waited for him there, flanked by kgb security guards. semichastny informed khrushchev of his ouster and told him not to resist. khrushchev did not resist, and the plotters coup went off smoothly; khrushchev felt betrayed by semichastny, as he considered him a friend and ally until that very moment, not suspecting that he had joined his enemies within the party. khrushchev was then taken to the kremlin, to be verbally attacked by brezhnev, suslov and shelepin. he had no stomach for a fight, and put up little resistance. semichastny was careful not to create the appearance of a coup i didn t even close the kremlin to visitors. people were strolling around outside, while in the room the presidium was meeting. i deployed my men around the kremlin. everything that was necessary was done. brezhnev and shelepin were nervous. i told them let s not do anything that isn t necessary. let s not create the appearance of a coup. that night, after his ouster, khrushchev called his friend and presidium colleague anastas mikoyan, and told him i m old and tired. let them cope by themselves. i ve done the main thing. could anyone have dreamed of telling stalin that he didn t suit us anymore and suggesting he retire? not even a wet spot would have remained where we had been standing. now everything is different. the fear is gone, and we can talk as equals. that s my contribution. i won t put up a fight. on october , the presidium and the central committee each voted to accept khrushchev s voluntary request to retire from his offices for reasons of advanced age and ill health. brezhnev was elected first secretary (later general secretary), while alexei kosygin succeeded khrushchev as premier. life in retirement edit khrushchev was granted a pension of rubles per month and was assured that his house and dacha were his for life. following his removal from power, he fell into deep depression. he received few visitors, especially since his security guards kept track of all guests and reported their comings and goings. in the fall of , he and his wife were ordered to leave their house and dacha to move to an apartment and to a smaller dacha in petrovo dalneye. his pension was reduced to rubles per month, though his retirement remained comfortable by soviet standards. the depression continued, and his doctor prescribed sleeping pills and tranquilizers. one of his grandsons was asked what the ex premier was doing in retirement, and the boy replied, grandfather cries. he was made a non person to such an extent that the thirty volume great soviet encyclopedia omitted his name from the list of prominent political commissars during the great patriotic war. as the new rulers made known their conservatism in artistic matters, khrushchev came to be more favorably viewed by artists and writers, some of whom visited him. one visitor whom khrushchev regretted not seeing was former u.s. vice president nixon, then in his wilderness years before his election to the presidency, who went to khrushchev s moscow apartment while the former premier was at his dacha. beginning in , khrushchev began his memoirs. he dictated them into a tape recorder and recorded indoors, after attempts failed to record outdoors due to background noise, knowing that every word would be heard by the kgb. however, the security agency made no attempt to interfere until , when khrushchev was ordered to turn over his tapes, which he refused to do. khrushchev was hospitalized with heart ailments when his son sergei was approached by the kgb and told that there was a plot afoot by foreign agents to steal the memoirs. sergei khrushchev turned over the materials to the kgb since the kgb could steal the originals anyway, but copies had been made, some of which had been transmitted to a western publisher. sergei instructed that the smuggled memoirs should be published, which they were in under the title khrushchev remembers. under some pressure, nikita khrushchev signed a statement that he had not given the materials to any publisher, and his son was transferred to a less desirable job. upon publication of the memoirs in the west, izvestia denounced them as a fraud. soviet state radio carried the announcement of khrushchev s statement, and it was the first time in six years that he had been mentioned in that medium. in the great soviet encyclopedia, khrushchev was given a short characterization in his activities, there were elements of subjectivism and voluntarism . in his final days, khrushchev visited his son in law and former aide alexei adzhubei and told him, never regret that you lived in stormy times and worked with me in the central committee. we will yet be remembered! death edit khrushchev died of a heart attack in a hospital near his home in moscow on september , at the age of . he was denied a state funeral with interment in the kremlin wall and was instead buried in the novodevichy cemetery in moscow. fearing demonstrations, the authorities did not announce khrushchev s death until the hour of his wake and surrounded the cemetery with troops. even so, some artists and writers joined the family at the graveside for the interment. pravda ran a one sentence announcement of the former premier s death; western newspapers contained considerable coverage. veteran new york times moscow correspondent harry schwartz wrote of khrushchev, mr. khrushchev opened the doors and windows of a petrified structure. he let in fresh air and fresh ideas, producing changes which time already has shown are irreversible and fundamental. legacy edit a khrushchyovka is destroyed, moscow, january many of khrushchev s innovations were reversed after his fall. the requirement that one third of officials be replaced at each election was overturned, as was the division in the party structure between industrial and agricultural sectors. his vocational education program for high school students was also dropped, and his plan for sending existing agricultural institutions out to the land was ended. however, new agricultural or vocational institutions thereafter were located outside major cities. when new housing was built, much of it was in the form of high rises rather than khrushchev s low rise structures, which lacked elevators or balconies. historian robert service summarizes khrushchev s contradictory personality traits. according to him, khrushchev was at once a stalinist and an anti stalinist, a communist believer and a cynic, a self publicizing poltroon and a crusty philanthropist, a trouble maker and a peacemaker, a stimulating colleague and a domineering boor, a statesman and a politicker who was out of his intellectual depth. some of khrushchev s agricultural projects were also easily overturned. corn became so unpopular in that its planting fell to the lowest level in the postwar period, as even kolkhozes which had been successful with it in ukraine and other southern portions of the ussr refused to plant it. lysenko was stripped of his policy making positions. however, the mts stations remained closed, and the basic agricultural problems, which khrushchev had tried to address, remained. while the soviet standard of living increased greatly in the ten years after khrushchev s fall, much of the increase was due to industrial progress; agriculture continued to lag far behind, resulting in regular agricultural crises, especially in and . brezhnev and his successors continued khrushchev s precedent of buying grain from the west rather than suffer shortfalls and starvation. neither brezhnev nor his colleagues were personally popular, and the new government relied on authoritarian power to assure its continuation. the kgb and red army were given increasing powers. the government s conservative tendencies would lead to the crushing of the prague spring of . decree of the presidium of the supreme soviet on the transfer of the crimean oblast . khrushchev transferred crimea from russian sfsr to ukrainian ssr. though khrushchev s strategy failed to achieve the major goals he sought, aleksandr fursenko, who wrote a book analyzing khrushchev s foreign and military policies, argued that the strategy did coerce the west in a limited manner. the agreement that the united states would not invade cuba has been adhered to. the refusal of the western world to acknowledge east germany was gradually eroded, and, in , the united states and other nato members signed the helsinki agreement with the ussr and warsaw pact nations, including east germany, setting human rights standards in europe. the russian public s view of khrushchev remains mixed. according to a major russian pollster, the only eras of the th century that russians evaluate positively are those under nicholas ii, and under khrushchev. a poll of young russians found that they felt nicholas ii had done more good than harm, and all other th century russian leaders more harm than good—except khrushchev, about whom they were evenly divided. subsequent polls, however, have found brezhnev and lenin the most popular russian leaders of the century. khrushchev biographer william tompson related the former premier s reforms to those which occurred later throughout the brezhnev years and the lengthy interregnum that followed, the generation which had come of age during the first russian spring of the s awaited its turn in power. as brezhnev and his colleagues died or were pensioned off, they were replaced by men and women for whom the secret speech and the first wave of de stalinization had been a formative experience, and these children of twentieth congress took up the reins of power under the leadership of mikhail gorbachev and his colleagues. the khrushchev era provided this second generation of reformers with both an inspiration and a cautionary tale. media portrayals edit british actor bob hoskins portrayed khrushchev in the film enemy at the gates, directed by jean jacques annaud and co written by annaud and alain godard. it was based on william craig s book enemy at the gates the battle for stalingrad; american actor steve buscemi played khrushchev in the satirical film the death of stalin, directed and co written by armando iannucci. it was adapted from the french novel written by fabien nury fr and thierry robin fr . see also edit transfer of crimea history of the soviet union ( – ) notes edit ^ ˈkrʊʃtʃɛf,

oblast, near the present ukrainian border. hi parents, sergei khrushchev and xeniya khrushcheva, were poor peasant of russian origin, and had a daughter two year nikita s junior, irina. sergei khrushchev wa employ in a number of posit in the donba area of far eastern ukraine, work as a railwayman, as a miner, and labour in a brick factory. wage were much higher in the donba than in the kursk region, and sergei khrushchev gener left hi famili in kalinovka, return there when he had enough money. kalinovka wa a peasant village; khrushchev s teacher, lydia shevchenko, later state that she had never seen a villag as poor as kalinovka had been. nikita work as a herdsboy from an earli age. he wa school for a total of four years, part in the villag parochi school and part under shevchenko s tutelag in kalinovka s state school. accord to khrushchev in hi memoirs, shevchenko wa a freethink who upset the villag by not attend church, and when her brother visited, he gave the boy book which had been ban by the imperi government. she urg nikita to seek further education, but famili financ did not permit this. in , sergei khrushchev move to the donba citi of yuzovka (now donetsk, ukraine); fourteen year old nikita follow later that year, while ksenia khrushcheva and her daughter came after. yuzovka, which wa renam stalino in and donetsk in , wa at the heart of one of the most industri area of the russian empire. after the boy work briefli in other fields, khrushchev s parent found him a place as a metal fitter s apprentice. upon complet that apprenticeship, the teenag khrushchev wa hire by a factory. he lost that job when he collect money for the famili of the victim of the lena goldfield massacre, and wa hire to mend underground equip by a mine in nearbi rutchenkovo, where hi father wa the union organiser, and he help distribut copi and organis public read of pravda. he later state that he consid emigr to the unit state for better wages, but did not do so. khrushchev and hi first wife euphrasinia (yefrosinia) in when world war i broke out in , khrushchev wa exempt from conscript becaus he wa a skill metal worker. he wa employ by a workshop that servic ten mines, and he wa involv in sever strike that demand higher pay, better work conditions, and an end to the war. in , he marri yefrosinia pisareva, daughter of the lift oper at the rutchenkovo mine. in , they had a daughter, yulia, and in , a son, leonid. after the abdic of tsar nichola ii in , the new russian provision govern in petrograd had littl influenc over ukraine. khrushchev wa elect to the worker s council (or soviet) in rutchenkovo, and in may he becam it chairman. he did not join the bolshevik until , a year in which the russian civil war, between the bolshevik and a coalit of oppon known as the white army, began in earnest. hi biographer, william taubman, suggest that khrushchev s delay in affili himself with the bolshevik wa becaus he felt closer to the menshevik who prioritis econom progress, wherea the bolshevik sought polit power. in hi memoirs, khrushchev indic that he wait becaus there were mani groups, and it wa difficult to keep them all straight. in march , as the bolshevik govern conclud a separ peac with the central powers, the german occupi the donba and khrushchev fled to kalinovka. in late or earli he wa mobil into the red armi as a polit commissar. the post of polit commissar had recent been introduc as the bolshevik came to reli less on worker activist and more on militari recruits; it function includ indoctrin of recruit in the tenet of bolshevism, and promot troop moral and battl readiness. begin as commissar to a construct platoon, khrushchev rose to becom commissar to a construct battalion and wa sent from the front for a two month polit course. the young commissar came under fire mani times, though mani of the war stori he would tell in later life dealt more with hi (and hi troop ) cultur awkwardness, rather than with combat. in , the civil war ended, and khrushchev wa demobilis and assign as commissar to a labour brigad in the donbas, where he and hi men live in poor conditions. the war had caus widespread devast and famine, and one of the victim of the hunger and diseas wa khrushchev s wife, yefrosinia, who die of typhu in kalinovka while khrushchev wa in the army. the commissar return for the funer and, loyal to hi bolshevik principles, refus to allow hi wife s coffin to enter the local church. with the onli way into the churchyard through the church, he had the coffin lift and pass over the fenc into the burial ground, shock the village. parti offici edit donba year edit through the intervent of a friend, khrushchev wa assign in as assist director for polit affair for the rutchenkovo mine in the donba region, where he had previous worked. there were as yet few bolshevik in the area. at that time, the movement wa split by lenin s new econom policy, which allow for some measur of privat enterpris and wa seen as an ideolog retreat by some bolsheviks. while khrushchev s respons lay in polit affairs, he involv himself in the practic of resum full product at the mine after the chao of the war years. he help restart the machin (key part and paper had been remov by the pre soviet mineowners) and he wore hi old mine outfit for inspect tours. khrushchev s third wife wa ukrainian born nina petrovna kukharchuk, whom he met in khrushchev wa highli success at the rutchenkovo mine, and in mid he wa offer the directorship of the nearbi pastukhov mine. however, he refus the offer, seek to be assign to the newli establish technic colleg (tekhnikum) in yuzovka, though hi superior were reluct to let him go. as he had onli four year of formal schooling, he appli to the train program (rabfak) attach to the tekhnikum that wa design to bring undereduc student to high school level, a prerequisit for entri into the tekhnikum. while enrol in the rabfak, khrushchev continu hi work at the rutchenkovo mine. one of hi teacher later describ him as a poor student. he wa more success in advanc in the communist party; soon after hi admiss to the rabfak in august , he wa appoint parti secretari of the entir tekhnikum, and becam a member of the bureau—th govern council—of the parti committe for the town of yuzovka (renam stalino in ). he briefli join support of leon trotski against those of joseph stalin over the question of parti democracy. all of these activ left him with littl time for hi schoolwork, and while he later claim to have finish hi rabfak studies, it is unclear whether thi wa true. in , khrushchev met and marri hi second wife, marusia, whose maiden name is unknown. the two soon separated, though khrushchev help marusia in later years, especi when marusia s daughter by a previou relationship suffer a fatal illness. soon after the abort marriage, khrushchev met nina petrovna kukharchuk, a well educ parti organ and daughter of well to do ukrainian peasants. the two live togeth as husband and wife for the rest of khrushchev s life, though they did not regist their marriag until . they had three children togeth daughter rada wa born in , son sergei in and daughter elena in . in mid , khrushchev wa appoint parti secretari of the petrovo marinski raikom, or district, near stalino. the raikom wa about squar mile ( , km ) in area, and khrushchev wa constantli on the move throughout hi domain, take an interest in even minor matters. in late , khrushchev wa elect a non vote deleg to the th congress of the ussr communist parti in moscow. kaganovich protégé edit nkvd chief genrikh yagoda (middle) inspect the construct of the moscow volga canal, . khrushchev is left behind yagoda. khrushchev met lazar kaganovich as earli as . in , kaganovich becam parti head in ukrain and khrushchev, fall under hi patronage, wa rapidli promoted. he wa appoint second in command of the stalino parti apparatu in late . within nine month hi superior, konstantin moiseyenko, wa ousted, which, accord to taubman, wa due to khrushchev s instigation. kaganovich transfer khrushchev to kharkov, then the capit of ukraine, as head of the organiz depart of the ukrainian parti s central committee. in , khrushchev wa transfer to kiev, where he serv as second in command of the parti organ there. in , khrushchev again sought to further hi education, follow kaganovich (now in the kremlin as a close associ of stalin) to moscow and enrol in the stalin industri academy. khrushchev never complet hi studi there, but hi career in the parti flourished. when the school s parti cell elect a number of rightist to an upcom district parti conference, the cell wa attack in pravda. khrushchev emerg victori in the ensu power struggle, becom parti secretari of the school, arrang for the deleg to be withdrawn, and afterward purg the cell of the rightists. khrushchev rose rapidli through the parti ranks, first becom parti leader for the bauman district, site of the academy, befor take the same posit in the krasnopresnenski district, the capit s largest and most important. by , khrushchev had becom second in command, behind kaganovich, of the moscow citi parti organization, and in , he becam parti leader for the citi and a member of the parti s central committee. khrushchev attribut hi rapid rise to hi acquaint with fellow academi student nadezhda alliluyeva, stalin s wife. in hi memoirs, khrushchev state that alliluyeva spoke well of him to her husband. hi biographer, william tompson, downplay the possibility, state that khrushchev wa too low in the parti hierarchi to enjoy stalin s patronage, and that if influenc wa brought to bear on khrushchev s career at thi stage, it wa by kaganovich. while head of the moscow citi organization, khrushchev superintend construct of the moscow metro, a highli expens undertaking, with kaganovich in overal charge. face with an alreadi announc open date of novemb , khrushchev took consider risk in the construct and spent much of hi time down in the tunnels. when the inevit accid did occur, they were depict as heroic sacrific in a great cause. the metro did not open until may , but khrushchev receiv the order of lenin for hi role in it construction. later that year, he wa select as first secretari of the moscow region committe which wa respons for moscow oblast, a provinc with a popul of million. involv in purg edit nestor lakoba, khrushchev, lavrenti beria and aghasi khanjian dure open of the moscow metro in . stalin s offic record show meet at which khrushchev wa present as earli as . the two increasingli built a good relationship. khrushchev greatli admir the dictat and treasur inform meet with him and invit to stalin s dacha, while stalin felt warm affect for hi young subordinate. khrushchev (sit first from left), head of moscow parti branch, with variou region parti leader in . stand first from right is mir jafar baghirov begin in , stalin began a campaign of polit repress known as the great purge, dure which million of peopl were execut or sent to the gulag. central to thi campaign were the moscow trials, a seri of show trial of the purg top leader of the parti and the military. in , as the trial proceeded, khrushchev express hi vehement support everyon who rejoic in the success achiev in our country, the victori of our parti led by the great stalin, will find onli one word suitabl for the mercenary, fascist dog of the trotskyit zinovievit gang. that word is execution. khrushchev assist in the purg of mani friend and colleagu in moscow oblast. of top parti offici in moscow citi and province, were kill —the three survivor were transfer to other part of the ussr. of the parti secretari of citi and district outsid moscow citi in the province, onli surviv the purges. in hi memoirs, khrushchev note that almost everyon who work with him wa arrested. by parti protocol, khrushchev wa requir to approv these arrests, and did littl or noth to save hi friend and colleagues. parti leader were given numer quota of enemi to be turn in and arrested. in june , the politburo set a quota of , enemi to be arrest in moscow province; , of these were to be executed. in reply, khrushchev ask that , wealthi peasants, or kulak live in moscow be kill in part fulfil of the quota. in ani event, onli two week after receiv the politburo order, khrushchev wa abl to report to stalin that , crimin and kulak element had been arrested. of the arrestees, accord to khrushchev, , deserv execution. khrushchev had no reason to think himself immun from the purges, and in , confess hi own dallianc with trotskyism to kaganovich, who, accord to khrushchev, blanch (for hi protégé s sin could affect hi own standing) and advis him to tell stalin. the dictat took the confess in hi stride, and, after initi advis khrushchev to keep it quiet, suggest that khrushchev tell hi tale to the moscow parti conference. khrushchev did so, to applause, and wa immedi reelect to hi post. khrushchev relat in hi memoir that he wa also denounc by an arrest colleague. stalin told khrushchev of the accus personally, look him in the eye and await hi response. khrushchev specul in hi memoir that had stalin doubt hi reaction, he would have been categor as an enemi of the peopl then and there. nonetheless, khrushchev becam a candid member of the politburo on januari and a full member in march . in late , stalin appoint khrushchev as head of the communist parti in ukraine, and khrushchev duli left moscow for kiev, again the ukrainian capital, in januari . ukrain had been the site of extens purges, with the murder includ professor in stalino whom khrushchev greatli respected. the high rank of the parti were not immune; the central committe of ukrain wa so devast that it could not conven a quorum. after khrushchev s arrival, the pace of arrest accelerated. all but one member of the ukrainian politburo organiz bureau and secretariat were arrested. almost all govern offici and red armi command were replaced. dure the first few month after khrushchev s arrival, almost everyon arrest receiv the death penalty. biograph william taubman suggest that becaus khrushchev wa again unsuccess denounc while in kiev, he must have known that some of the denunci were not true and that innoc peopl were suffering. in , khrushchev address the fourteenth ukrainian parti congress, say comrades, we must unmask and relentlessli destroy all enemi of the people. but we must not allow a singl honest bolshevik to be harmed. we must conduct a struggl against slanderers. world war ii edit occup of polish territori edit when soviet troops, pursuant to the molotov–ribbentrop pact, invad the eastern portion of poland on septemb , khrushchev accompani the troop at stalin s direction. a larg number of ethnic ukrainian live in the invad area, much of which today form the western portion of ukraine. mani inhabit therefor initi welcom the invasion, though they hope that they would eventu becom independent. khrushchev s role wa to ensur that the occupi area vote for union with the ussr. through a combin of propaganda, decept as to what wa be vote for, and outright fraud, the soviet ensur that their new territori would elect assembl which would unanim petit for union with the ussr. when the new assembl did so, their petit were grant by the ussr suprem soviet, and western ukrain becam a part of the ukrainian soviet socialist republ (ukrainian ssr) on novemb . clumsi action by the soviets, such as staf western ukrainian organ with eastern ukrainians, and give confisc land to collect farm (kolkhozes) rather than to peasants, soon alien western ukrainians, damag khrushchev s effort to achiev unity. war against germani edit when nazi germani invad the ussr, in june , khrushchev wa still at hi post in kiev. stalin appoint him a polit commissar, and khrushchev serv on a number of front as an intermediari between the local militari command and the polit ruler in moscow. stalin use khrushchev to keep command on a tight leash, while the command sought to have him influenc stalin. as the german advanced, khrushchev work with the militari in an attempt to defend and save kiev. handicap by order from stalin that under no circumst should the citi be abandoned, the red armi wa soon encircl by the germans. while the german state they took , prisoners, accord to the soviets, , men out of , escap the trap. primari sourc differ on khrushchev s involv at thi point. accord to marshal georgi zhukov, write some year after khrushchev fire and disgrac him in , khrushchev persuad stalin not to evacu troop from kiev. however, khrushchev note in hi memoir that he and marshal semyon budyonni propos redeploy soviet forc to avoid the encircl until marshal semyon timoshenko arriv from moscow with order for the troop to hold their positions. earli khrushchev biograph mark frankland suggest that khrushchev s faith in hi leader wa first shaken by the red armi s setbacks. khrushchev state in hi memoir .mw parser output .templatequot overflow hidden;margin em ;pad px .mw parser output .templatequot .templatequotecit line height . em;text align left;pad left . em;margin top but let me return to the enemi breakthrough in the kiev area, the encircl of our group, and the destruct of the th army. later, the fifth armi also perish ... all of thi wa senseless, and from the militari point of view, a display of ignorance, incompetence, and illiteracy. ... there you have the result of not take a step backward. we were unabl to save these troop becaus we didn t withdraw them, and as a result we simpli lost them. ... and yet it wa possibl to allow thi not to happen. in , khrushchev wa on the southwest front, and he and timoshenko propos a massiv counteroffens in the kharkov area. stalin approv onli part of the plan, but , red armi soldier would still becom involv in the offensive. the germans, however, had deduc that the soviet were like to attack at kharkov, and set a trap. begin on may , the soviet offens initi appear successful, but within five day the german had driven deep into the soviet flanks, and the red armi troop were in danger of be cut off. stalin refus to halt the offensive, and the red armi divis were soon encircl by the germans. the ussr lost about , soldiers, includ more than , men captured, and stalin demot timoshenko and recal khrushchev to moscow. while stalin hint at arrest and execut khrushchev, he allow the commissar to return to the front by send him to stalingrad. khrushchev (left) on the stalingrad front khrushchev reach the stalingrad front in august , soon after the start of the battl for the city. hi role in the stalingrad defens wa not major—gener vasili chuikov, who led the citi s defense, mention khrushchev onli briefli in a memoir publish while khrushchev wa premier—but to the end of hi life, he wa proud of hi role. though he visit stalin in moscow on occasion, he remain in stalingrad for much of the battle, and wa nearli kill at least once. he propos a counterattack, onli to find that zhukov and other gener had alreadi plan oper uranus, a plan to break out from soviet posit and encircl and destroy the germans; it wa be kept secret. befor uranu wa launched, khrushchev spent much time check on troop readi and morale, interrog nazi prisoners, and recruit some for propaganda purposes. soon after stalingrad, khrushchev met with person tragedy, as hi son leonid, a fighter pilot, wa appar shot down and kill in action on march . the circumst of leonid s death remain obscur and controversial, as none of hi fellow flier state that they wit him be shot down, nor wa hi plane found or bodi recovered. as a result, leonid s fate ha been the subject of consider speculation. one theori ha leonid surviv the crash and collabor with the germans, and when he wa recaptur by the soviets, stalin order him shot despit nikita khrushchev plead for hi life. thi suppos kill is use to explain whi khrushchev later denounc stalin in the secret speech. while there is no support evid for thi account in soviet files, some historian alleg that leonid khrushchev s file wa tamper with after the war. in later years, leonid khrushchev s wingmat state that he saw hi plane disintegrate, but did not report it. khrushchev biograph taubman specul that thi omiss wa most like to avoid the possibl of be seen as complicit in the death of the son of a politburo member. in mid , leonid s wife, liuba khrushcheva, wa arrest on accus of spi and sentenc to five year in a labor camp, and her son (bi anoth relationship), tolya, wa place in a seri of orphanages. leonid s daughter, yulia, wa rais by nikita khrushchev and hi wife. after uranu forc the german into retreat, khrushchev serv in other front of the war. he wa attach to soviet troop at the battl of kursk, in juli , which turn back the last major german offens on soviet soil. khrushchev relat that he interrog an ss defector, learn that the german intend an attack—a claim dismiss by hi biograph taubman as almost certainli exagger . he accompani soviet troop as they took kiev in novemb , enter the shatter citi as soviet forc drove out german troops. as soviet forc met with greater success, drive the nazi westward toward germany, nikita khrushchev becam increasingli involv in reconstruct work in ukraine. he wa appoint premier of the ukrainian ssr in addit to hi earlier parti post, one of the rare instanc in which the ukrainian parti and civil leader post were held by one person. accord to khrushchev biograph william tompson, it is difficult to assess khrushchev s war record, sinc he most often act as part of a militari council, and it is not possibl to know the extent to which he influenc decisions, rather than sign off on the order of militari officers. however, tompson point to the fact that the few mention of khrushchev in militari memoir publish dure the brezhnev era were gener favorable, at a time when it wa bare possibl to mention khrushchev in print in ani context . tompson suggest that these favor mention indic that militari offic held khrushchev in high regard. rise to power edit return to ukrain edit almost all of ukrain had been occupi by the germans, and khrushchev return to hi domain in late to find devastation. ukrain s industri had been destroyed, and agricultur face critic shortages. even though million of ukrainian had been taken to germani as worker or prison of war, there wa insuffici hous for those who remained. one out of everi six ukrainian wa kill in world war ii. khrushchev sought to reconstruct ukraine, but also desir to complet the interrupt work of impos the soviet system on it, though he hope that the purg of the s would not recur. as ukrain wa recov militarily, conscript wa imposed, and , men age between nineteen and fifti were given minim militari train and sent to join the red army. other ukrainian join partisan forces, seek an independ ukraine. khrushchev rush from district to district through ukraine, urg the deplet labor forc to greater efforts. he made a short visit to hi birthplac of kalinovka, find a starv population, with onli a third of the men who had join the red armi have returned. khrushchev did what he could to assist hi hometown. despit khrushchev s efforts, in , ukrainian industri wa at onli a quarter of pre war levels, and the harvest actual drop from that of , when the entir territori of ukrain had not yet been retaken. in an effort to increas agricultur production, the kolkhoz (collect farms) were empow to expel resid who were not pull their weight. kolkhoz leader use thi as an excus to expel their person enemies, invalids, and the elderly, and nearli , peopl were sent to the eastern part of the soviet union. khrushchev view thi polici as veri effective, and recommend it adopt elsewher to stalin. he also work to impos collectiv on western ukraine. while khrushchev hope to accomplish thi by , lack of resourc and arm resist by partisan slow the process. the partisans, mani of whom fought as the ukrainian insurg armi (upa), were gradual defeated, as soviet polic and militari report kill , bandit and captur a quarter million more between and . about , western ukrainian were arrest between and , with one third execut and the remaind imprison or exil to the east. the war year of and had seen poor harvests, and saw intens drought strike ukrain and western russia. despit this, collect and state farm were requir to turn over % of the harvest to the government. the soviet govern sought to collect as much grain as possibl in order to suppli communist alli in eastern europe. khrushchev set the quota at a high level, lead stalin to expect an unrealist larg quantiti of grain from ukraine. food wa rationed—but non agricultur rural worker throughout the ussr were given no ration cards. the inevit starvat wa larg confin to remot rural regions, and wa littl notic outsid the ussr. khrushchev, realiz the desper situat in late , repeatedli appeal to stalin for aid, to be met with anger and resist on the part of the leader. when letter to stalin had no effect, khrushchev flew to moscow and made hi case in person. stalin final gave ukrain limit food aid, and money to set up free soup kitchens. however, khrushchev s polit stand had been damaged, and in februari , stalin suggest that lazar kaganovich be sent to ukrain to help khrushchev. the follow month, the ukrainian central committe remov khrushchev as parti leader in favor of kaganovich, while retain him as premier. soon after kaganovich arriv in kiev, khrushchev fell ill, and wa bare seen until septemb . in hi memoirs, khrushchev indic he had pneumonia; some biograph have theoriz that khrushchev s ill wa entir political, out of fear that hi loss of posit wa the first step toward downfal and demise. however, khrushchev s children rememb their father as have been serious ill. onc khrushchev wa abl to get out of bed, he and hi famili took their first vacat sinc befor the war, to a beachfront resort in latvia. khrushchev, though, soon broke the beach routin with duck hunt trips, and a visit to newli soviet kaliningrad, where he tour factori and quarries. by the end of , kaganovich had been recal to moscow and the recov khrushchev had been restor to the first secretaryship. he then resign the ukrainian premiership in favor of demyan korotchenko, khrushchev s protégé. khrushchev s final year in ukrain were gener peaceful, with industri recovering, soviet forc overcom the partisans, and and see better than expect harvests. collectiv advanc in western ukraine, and khrushchev implement more polici that encourag collectiv and discourag privat farms. these sometim backfired, howev a tax on privat livestock hold led to peasant slaughter their stock. with the idea of elimin differ in attitud between town and countrysid and transform the peasantri into a rural proletariat , khrushchev conceiv the idea of the agro town . rather than agricultur worker live in villag close to farms, they would live further away in larger town which would offer municip servic such as util and libraries, which were not present in villages. he complet onli one such town befor hi decemb return to moscow; he dedic it to stalin as a th birthday present. in hi memoirs, khrushchev spoke highli of ukraine, where he govern for over a decad i ll say that the ukrainian peopl treat me well. i recal warmli the year i spent there. thi wa a period full of responsibilities, but pleasant becaus it brought satisfact ... but far be it from me to inflat my significance. the entir ukrainian peopl wa exert great effort ... i attribut ukrain s success to the ukrainian peopl as a whole. i won t elabor further on thi theme, but in principl it s veri easi to demonstrate. i m russian myself, and i don t want to offend the russians. stalin s final year edit khrushchev attribut hi recal to moscow to mental disord on the part of stalin, who fear conspiraci in moscow match those which the ruler believ to have occur in the fabric leningrad case, in which mani of that citi s parti offici had been fals accus of treason. khrushchev again serv as head of the parti in moscow citi and province. khrushchev biograph taubman suggest that stalin most like recal khrushchev to moscow to balanc the influenc of georgi malenkov and secur chief lavrentiy beria, who were wide seen as stalin s heirs. at thi time, the age leader rare call politburo meetings. instead, much of the high level work of govern took place at dinner host by stalin. these sessions, which beria, malenkov, khrushchev, kaganovich, kliment voroshilov, vyacheslav molotov, and nikolai bulganin, who compris stalin s inner circle, attended, began with show of cowboy movi favor by stalin. stolen from the west, they lack subtitles. the dictat had the meal serv at around a.m., and insist that hi subordin stay with him and drink until dawn. on one occasion, stalin had khrushchev, then age almost sixty, danc a tradit ukrainian dance. khrushchev did so, later stating, when stalin say dance, a wise man dances. khrushchev attempt to nap at lunch so that he would not fall asleep in stalin s presence; he note in hi memoirs, thing went badli for those who doze off at stalin s table. in , khrushchev began a larg scale hous program for moscow. a larg part of the hous wa in the form of five or six stori apart buildings, which becam ubiquit throughout the soviet union; mani remain in use today. khrushchev had prefabr reinforc concret used, greatli speed up construction. these structur were complet at tripl the construct rate of moscow hous from – , lack elev or balconies, and were nicknam khrushchyovka by the public, but becaus of their shoddi workmanship sometim disparagingli call khrushchoba as a portmanteau combin khrushchev s name with the russian word trushchoba, mean slum . in , almost , , resid of the former soviet union still live in these buildings. in hi new positions, khrushchev continu hi kolkhoz consolid scheme, which decreas the number of collect farm in moscow provinc by about %. thi result in farm that were too larg for one chairman to manag effectively. khrushchev also sought to implement hi agro town proposal, but when hi lengthi speech on the subject wa publish in pravda in march , stalin disapprov of it. the period quickli publish a note state that khrushchev s speech wa mere a proposal, not policy. in april, the politburo disavow the agro town proposal. khrushchev fear that stalin would remov him from office, but the leader mock khrushchev, then allow the episod to pass. on march , stalin suffer a massiv stroke, appar on rise after sleep. stalin had left order not to be disturbed, and it wa twelv hour until hi condit wa discovered. even as terrifi doctor attempt treatment, khrushchev and hi colleagu engag in intens discuss as to the new government. on march, stalin died. as khrushchev and other high offici stood weep by stalin s bedside, beria race from the room, shout for hi car. khrushchev reflect on stalin in hi memoir stalin call everyon who didn t agre with him an enemi of the people. he said that they want to restor the old order, and for thi purpose, the enemi of the peopl had link up with the forc of reaction internationally. as a result, sever hundr thousand honest peopl perished. everyon live in fear in those days. everyon expect that at ani moment there would be a knock on the door in the middl of the night and that knock on the door would prove fatal ... p eopl not to stalin s like were annihilated, honest parti members, irreproach people, loyal and hard worker for our caus who had gone through the school of revolutionari struggl under lenin s leadership. thi wa utter and complet arbitrariness. and now is all thi to be forgiven and forgotten? never! struggl for control edit on march , stalin s death wa announced, as wa the new leadership. malenkov wa the new chairman of the council of ministers, with beria (who consolid hi hold over the secur agencies), kaganovich, bulganin, and former foreign minist vyacheslav molotov as first vice chairmen. stalin s funer wa conduct on march. those member of the presidium of the central committe who had been recent promot by stalin were demoted. khrushchev wa reliev of hi duti as parti head for moscow to concentr on unspecifi duti in the parti s central committee. the new york time list malenkov and beria first and second among the ten man presidium—and khrushchev last. however, on march, malenkov resign from the secretariat of the central committee. thi came due to concern that he wa acquir too much power. the major beneficiari wa khrushchev. hi name appear atop a revis list of secretaries—ind that he wa now in charg of the party. the central committe formal elect him first secretari in september. even befor stalin had been laid to rest, beria launch a lengthi seri of reform which rival those of khrushchev dure hi period of power and even those of mikhail gorbachev a third of a centuri later. beria s propos were design to denigr stalin and pass the blame for beria s own crime to the late leader. one proposal, which wa adopted, wa an amnesti which eventu led to the free of over a million prisoners. another, which wa not adopted, wa to releas east germani into a united, neutral germani in exchang for compens from the west —a propos consid by khrushchev to be anti communist. khrushchev alli with malenkov to block mani of beria s proposals, while the two slowli pick up support from other presidium members. their campaign against beria wa aid by fear that beria wa plan a militari coup, and, accord to khrushchev in hi memoirs, by the convict that beria is get hi knive readi for us. on june beria wa arrest at a presidium meeting, follow extens militari prepar by khrushchev and hi allies. beria wa tri in secret, and execut in decemb with five of hi close associates. the execut of beria prove to be the last time the loser of a top level soviet power struggl paid with hi life. the power struggl in the presidium wa not resolv by the elimin of beria. malenkov s power wa in the central state apparatus, which he sought to extend through reorgan the government, give it addit power at the expens of the party. he also sought public support by lower retail price and lower the level of bond sale to citizens, which had long been effect obligatory. khrushchev, on the other hand, with hi power base in the party, sought to both strengthen the parti and hi posit within it. while, under the soviet system, the parti wa to be preeminent, it had been greatli drain of power by stalin, who had given much of that power to himself and to the politburo (later, to the presidium). khrushchev saw that with the presidium in conflict, the parti and it central committe might again becom powerful. khrushchev care cultiv high parti officials, and wa abl to appoint support as local parti bosses, who then took seat on the central committee. khrushchev present himself as a down to earth activist prepar to take up ani challenge, contrast with malenkov who, though sophisticated, came across as colorless. khrushchev arrang for the kremlin ground to be open to the public, an act with great public reson . while both malenkov and khrushchev sought reform to agriculture, khrushchev s propos were broader, and includ the virgin land campaign, under which hundr of thousand of young volunt would settl and farm area of western siberia and northern kazakhstan. while the scheme eventu becam a tremend disast for soviet agriculture, it wa initi successful. in addition, khrushchev possess incrimin inform on malenkov, taken from beria s secret files. as soviet prosecutor investig the atroc of stalin s last years, includ the leningrad case, they came across evid of malenkov s involvement. begin in februari , khrushchev replac malenkov in the seat of honor at presidium meetings; in june, malenkov ceas to head the list of presidium members, which wa thereaft organ in alphabet order. khrushchev s influenc continu to increase, win the allegi of local parti heads, and with hi nomine head the kgb. at a central committe meet in januari , malenkov wa accus of involv in atrocities, and the committe pass a resolut accus him of involv in the leningrad case, and of facilit beria s climb to power. at a meet of the mostli ceremoni suprem soviet the follow month, malenkov wa demot in favor of bulganin, to the surpris of western observers. malenkov remain in the presidium as minist of electr power stations. accord to khrushchev biograph william tompson, khrushchev s posit as first among the member of the collect leadership wa now beyond ani reason doubt. leader ( – ) edit domest polici edit consolid of power; secret speech edit main articl secret speech after the demot of malenkov, khrushchev and molotov initi work togeth well, and the longtim foreign minist even propos that khrushchev, not bulganin, replac malenkov as premier. however, khrushchev and molotov increasingli differ on policy. molotov oppos the virgin land policy, instead propos heavi invest to increas yield in develop agricultur areas, which khrushchev felt wa not feasibl due to a lack of resourc and a lack of a sophist farm labor force. the two differ on foreign polici as well; soon after khrushchev took power, he sought a peac treati with austria, which would allow soviet troop then in occup of part of the countri to leave. molotov wa resistant, but khrushchev arrang for an austrian deleg to come to moscow and negoti the treaty. although khrushchev and other presidium member attack molotov at a central committe meet in mid , accus him of conduct a foreign polici which turn the world against the ussr, molotov remain in hi position. by the end of , thousand of polit prison had return home, and told their experi of the gulag labor camps. continu investig into the abus brought home the full breadth of stalin s crime to hi successors. khrushchev believ that onc the stain of stalin wa removed, the parti would inspir loyalti among the people. begin in octob , khrushchev fought to tell the deleg to the upcom th parti congress about stalin s crimes. some of hi colleagues, includ molotov and malenkov, oppos the disclosure, and manag to persuad him to make hi remark in a close session. the th parti congress open on februari . in hi open word in hi initi address, khrushchev denigr stalin by ask deleg to rise in honor of the communist leader who had die sinc the last congress, whom he named, equat stalin with klement gottwald and the littl known kyuichi tokuda. in the earli morn hour of february, khrushchev deliv what becam known as the secret speech to a close session of the congress limit to soviet delegates. in four hours, he demolish stalin s reputation. khrushchev note in hi memoir that the congress listen to me in silence. as the say goes, you could have heard a pin drop. it wa all so sudden and unexpected. khrushchev told the deleg it is here that stalin show in a whole seri of case hi intolerance, hi brutality, and hi abus of power ... he often chose the path of repress and physic annihilation, not onli against actual enemies, but also against individu who had not commit ani crime against the parti or the soviet government. the secret speech, while it did not fundament chang soviet society, had wide rang effects. the speech wa a factor in unrest in poland and revolut in hungari later in , and stalin defend led four day of riot in hi nativ georgia in june, call for khrushchev to resign and molotov to take over. in meet where the secret speech wa read, communist would make even more sever condemn of stalin (and of khrushchev), and even call for multi parti elections. however, stalin wa not publicli denounced, and hi portrait remain widespread through the ussr, from airport to khrushchev s kremlin office. mikhail gorbachev, then a komsomol official, recal that though young and well educ soviet in hi district were excit by the speech, mani other decri it, either defend stalin or see littl point in dig up the past. forti year later, after the fall of the soviet union, gorbachev applaud khrushchev for hi courag in take a huge polit risk and show himself to be a moral man after all . the term secret speech prove to be an utter misnomer. while the attende at the speech were all soviet, eastern european deleg were allow to hear it the follow night, read slowli to allow them to take notes. by march, copi were be mail throughout the soviet union, mark not for the press rather than top secret . an offici translat appear within a month in poland; the pole print , extra copies, one of which soon reach the west. khrushchev s son, sergei, later wrote, c learly, father tri to ensur it would reach as mani ear as possible. it wa soon read at komsomol meetings; that meant anoth eighteen million listeners. if you includ their relatives, friends, and acquaintances, you could say that the entir countri becam familiar with the speech ... spring had bare begun when the speech began circul around the world. the anti khrushchev minor in the presidium wa augment by those oppos to khrushchev s propos to decentr author over industry, which struck at the heart of malenkov s power base. dure the first half of , malenkov, molotov, and kaganovich work to quietli build support to dismiss khrushchev. at an june presidium meet at which two khrushchev support were absent, the plotter move that bulganin, who had join the scheme, take the chair, and propos other move which would effect demot khrushchev and put themselv in control. khrushchev object on the ground that not all presidium member had been notified, an object which would have been quickli dismiss had khrushchev not held firm control over the military, through minist of defens marshal zhukov, and the secur departments. lengthi presidium meet took place, continu over sever days. as word leak of the power struggle, member of the central committee, which khrushchev controlled, stream to moscow, mani flown there aboard militari planes, and demand to be admit to the meeting. while they were not admitted, there were soon enough central committe member in moscow to call an emerg parti congress, which effect forc the leadership to allow a session of the central committee. at that meeting, the three main conspir were dub the anti parti group, accus of faction and complic in stalin s crimes. the three were expel from the central committe and presidium, as wa former foreign minist and khrushchev client dmitri shepilov who join them in the plot. molotov wa sent as ambassador to mongolia; the other were sent to head industri facil and institut far from moscow. marshal zhukov wa reward for hi support with full membership in the presidium, but khrushchev fear hi popular and power. in october, the defens minist wa sent on a tour of the balkans, as khrushchev arrang a presidium meet to dismiss him. zhukov learn what wa happening, and hurri back to moscow, onli to be formal notifi of hi dismissal. at a central committe meet sever week later, not a word wa said in zhukov s defense. khrushchev complet the consolid of power by arrang for bulganin s dismiss as premier in favor of himself (bulganin wa appoint to head the gosbank) and by establish a ussr defens council, led by himself, effect make him command in chief. though khrushchev wa now preeminent, he did not enjoy stalin s absolut power. liber and the art edit main articl khrushchev thaw nina khrushcheva, mami eisenhower, khrushchev, and dwight eisenhow at a state dinner in after assum power, khrushchev allow a modest amount of freedom in the arts. vladimir dudintsev s not by bread alone, about an idealist engin oppos by rigid bureaucrats, wa allow to be publish in , though khrushchev call the novel fals at it base . in , however, khrushchev order a fierc attack on bori pasternak after hi novel doctor zhivago wa publish abroad (he wa deni permiss to publish it in the soviet union). pravda describ the novel as low grade reactionari hackwork , and the author wa expel from the writer s union. to make thing wors (from khrushchev s perspective), pasternak wa award the nobel prize for literature, which, under heavi pressure, he declined. onc he did so, khrushchev order a halt to the attack on pasternak. in hi memoirs, khrushchev state that he agon over the novel, veri nearli allow it to be published, and later regret not do so. after hi fall from power, khrushchev obtain a copi of the novel and read it (he had earlier read onli excerpts) and stated, we shouldn t have ban it. i should have read it myself. there s noth anti soviet in it. khrushchev believ that the ussr could match the west s live standards, and wa not afraid to allow soviet citizen to see western achievements. stalin had permit few tourist to the soviet union, and had allow few soviet to travel. khrushchev let soviet travel (over , soviet citizen travel abroad in ) and allow foreign to visit the soviet union, where tourist becam subject of immens curiosity. in , khrushchev author the th world festiv of youth and student to be held in moscow that summer. he instruct komsomol offici to smother foreign guest in our embrac . the result socialist carniv involv over three million moscovites, who join with , young foreign visitor in event that rang from discuss group throughout the citi to event at the kremlin itself. accord to historian vladislav zubok, the festiv shatter propagandist cliché about western by allow moscovit to see them for themselves. in , khrushchev, impress by aleksandr solzhenitsyn s one day in the life of ivan denisovich, persuad the presidium to allow publication. that renew thaw end on decemb , when khrushchev wa taken to the manezh galleri to view an exhibit which includ a number of avant gard works. on see them, khrushchev explod with anger, an episod known as the maneg affair, describ the artwork as dog shit , and proclaim that a donkey could smear better art with it tail . a week later, pravda issu a call for artist purity. when writer and filmmak defend the painters, khrushchev extend hi anger to them. however, despit the premier s rage, none of the artist were arrest or exiled. the manezh galleri exhibit remain open for some time after khrushchev s visit, and experienc a consider rise in attend after the articl in pravda. polit reform edit under khrushchev, the special tribun oper by secur agenc were abolished. these tribun (known as troikas), had often ignor law and procedures. under the reforms, no prosecut for a polit crime could be brought even in the regular court unless approv by the local parti committee. thi rare happened; there were no major polit trial under khrushchev, and at most sever hundr polit prosecut overall. instead, other sanction were impos on soviet dissidents, includ loss of job or univers position, or expuls from the party. dure khrushchev s rule, forc hospit for the social danger wa introduced. accord to author roy medvedev, who wrote an earli analysi of khrushchev s year in power, polit terror as an everyday method of govern wa replac under khrushchev by administr mean of repress . nikita khrushchev, time magazin s man of the year for in , khrushchev open a central committe meet to hundr of soviet officials; some were even allow to address the meeting. for the first time, the proceed of the committe were made public in book form, a practic which wa continu at subsequ meetings. thi openness, however, actual allow khrushchev greater control over the committee, sinc ani dissent would have to make their case in front of a large, disapprov crowd. in , khrushchev divid oblast level parti committe (obkoms) into two parallel structures, one for industri and one for agriculture. thi wa unpopular among parti apparatchiks, and led to confus in the chain of command, as neither committe secretari had preced over the other. as there were limit number of central committe seat from each oblast, the divis set up the possibl of rivalri for offic between factions, and, accord to medvedev, had the potenti for begin a two parti system. khrushchev also order that one third of the membership of each committee, from low level council to the central committe itself, be replac at each election. thi decre creat tension between khrushchev and the central committee, and upset the parti leader upon whose support khrushchev had risen to power. agricultur polici edit sinc the s, khrushchev had advoc the cultiv of corn (maize) in the soviet union. he establish a corn institut in ukrain and order thousand of acr to be plant with corn in the virgin lands. in februari , khrushchev gave a speech in which he advoc an iowa style corn belt in the soviet union, and a soviet deleg visit the u.s. state that summer. while their intent wa to visit onli small farms, the deleg chief wa approach by farmer and corn salesman roswel garst, who persuad him to insist on visit garst s larg farm. the iowan visit the soviet union in september, where he becam great friend with khrushchev, and garst sold the ussr , short ton ( , t) of seed corn. garst warn the soviet to grow the corn in the southern part of the country, and to ensur there were suffici stock of fertilizer, insecticides, and herbicides. this, however, wa not done, as khrushchev sought to plant corn even in siberia, and without the necessari chemicals. while khrushchev warn against those who would have us plant the whole planet with corn , he display a great passion for corn, so much so that when he visit a latvian kolkhoz, he state that some in hi audienc were probabl wondering, will khrushchev say someth about corn or won t he? he did, rebuk the farmer for not plant more corn. the corn experi wa not a great success, and he later wrote that overenthusiast officials, want to pleas him, had overpl without lay the proper groundwork, and as a result corn wa discredit as a silag crop—and so wa i . khrushchev sought to abolish the machin tractor station (mts) which not onli own most larg agricultur machin such as combin and tractors, but also provid servic such as plowing, and transfer their equip and function to the kolkhoz and sovkhoz (state farms). after a success test involv mt which serv one larg kolkhoz each, khrushchev order a gradual transition—but then order that the chang take place with great speed. within three months, over half of the mt facil had been closed, and kolkhoz were be requir to buy the equipment, with no discount given for older or dilapid machines. mt employees, unwil to bind themselv to kolkhoz and lose their state employe benefit and the right to chang their jobs, fled to the cities, creat a shortag of skill operators. the cost of the machinery, plu the cost of build storag shed and fuel tank for the equipment, impoverish mani kolkhozes. inadequ provis were made for repair stations. without the mts, the market for soviet agricultur equip fell apart, as the kolkhoz now had neither the money nor skill buyer to purchas new equipment. one advis to khrushchev wa trofim lysenko, who promis greatli increas product with minim investment. such scheme were attract to khrushchev, who order them implemented. lysenko manag to maintain hi influenc under khrushchev despit repeat failures; as each propos failed, he advoc another. lysenko s influenc greatli retard the develop of genet scienc in the soviet union. in , khrushchev announc a goal of overtak the unit state in product of milk, meat, and butter. local officials, with khrushchev s encouragement, made unrealist pledg of production. these goal were met by forc farmer to slaughter their breed herd and by purchas meat at state stores, then resel it back to the government, artifici increas record production. in june , food price were raised, particularli on meat and butter (bi – %). thi caus public discontent. in the southern russian citi of novocherkassk (rostov region), thi discont escal to a strike and a revolt against the authorities. the revolt wa put down by the military. accord to soviet offici accounts, peopl were kill and wounded. in addition, demonstr were convict of involv and seven of them executed. inform about the revolt wa complet suppress in the ussr, but spread through samizdat and damag khrushchev s reput in the west. drought struck the soviet union in ; the harvest of , , short ton ( , , t) of grain wa down from a peak of , , short ton ( , , t) in . the shortag result in bread lines, a fact at first kept from khrushchev. reluct to purchas food in the west, but face with the altern of widespread hunger, khrushchev exhaust the nation s hard currenc reserv and expend part of it gold stockpil in the purchas of grain and other foodstuffs. educ edit khrushchev (right) with cosmonaut yuri gagarin, pavel popovich and valentina tereshkova, while visit the unit state in , khrushchev wa greatli impress by the agricultur educ program at iowa state university, and sought to imit it in the soviet union. at the time, the main agricultur colleg in the ussr wa in moscow, and student did not do the manual labor of farming. khrushchev propos to move the program to rural areas. he wa unsuccessful, due to resist from professor and students, who never actual disagre with the premier, but who did not carri out hi proposals. khrushchev recal in hi memoirs, it s nice to live in moscow and work at the timiryazev agricultur academy. it s a vener old institution, a larg econom unit, with skill instructors, but it s in the city! it student aren t yearn to work on the collect farm becaus to do that they d have to go out in the provinc and live in the sticks. khrushchev found sever academ towns, such as akademgorodok. the premier believ that western scienc flourish becaus mani scientist live in univers town such as oxford, isol from big citi distractions, and had pleasant live condit and good pay. he sought to duplic those condit in the soviet union. khrushchev s attempt wa gener successful, though hi new town and scientif center tend to attract younger scientists, with older one unwil to leav moscow or leningrad. khrushchev also propos to restructur soviet high schools. while the high school provid a colleg preparatori curriculum, in fact few soviet youth went on to university. khrushchev want to shift the focu of secondari school to vocat train student would spend much of their time at factori job or in apprenticeship and onli a small part at the schools. in practice, what occur is that school develop link with nearbi enterprises, and student went to work for onli one or two day a week; the factori and other work dislik have to teach, while student and their famili complain that they had littl choic in what trade to learn. while the vocat propos would not surviv khrushchev s downfall, a longer last chang wa a relat establish of special high school for gift student or those wish to studi a specif subject. these school were model after the foreign languag school that had been establish in moscow and leningrad begin in . in , a special summer school wa establish in novosibirsk to prepar student for a siberian math and scienc olympiad. the follow year, the novosibirsk math and scienc board school becam the first perman residenti school special in math and science. other such school were soon establish in moscow, leningrad, and kiev. by the earli s, over special school had been established, in mathematics, the sciences, art, music, and sport. preschool educ wa increas as part of khrushchev s reforms, and by the time he left office, about % of soviet children attend preschool—about half of urban children, but onli about % of rural children. religion edit the anti religi campaign of the khrushchev era began in , coincid with the st parti congress in the same year. it wa carri out by mass closur of church (reduc the number from , in to , in and to , by ), monasteries, and convents, as well as of the still exist seminari (pastor cours would be ban in general). the campaign also includ a restrict of parent right for teach religion to their children, a ban on the presenc of children at church servic (begin in with the baptist and then extend to the orthodox in ), and a ban on administr of the eucharist to children over the age of four. khrushchev addit ban all servic held outsid of church walls, renew enforc of the legisl ban pilgrimages, and record the person ident of all adult request church baptisms, wed or funerals. he also disallow the ring of church bell and servic in daytim in some rural set from may to the end of octob under the pretext of field work requirements. non fulfil of these regul by clergi would lead to disallow of state registr for them (which meant they could no longer do ani pastor work or liturgi at all, without special state permission). accord to dimitri pospielovsky, the state carri out forc retirement, arrest and prison sentenc on clergymen for trump up charg , but he write that it wa in realiti for resist the closur of church and for give sermon attack atheism or the anti religi campaign, or who conduct christian chariti or who made religion popular by person example. foreign and defens polici edit khrushchev (row the boat) with the swedish prime minist tage erlander, when khrushchev took control, the outsid world still knew littl of him, and initi wa not impress by him. short, heavyset, and wear ill fit suits, he radiat energi but not intellect , and wa dismiss by mani as a buffoon who would not last long. british foreign secretari harold macmillan wondered, how can thi fat, vulgar man with hi pig eye and ceaseless flow of talk be the head—th aspir tsar for all those million of people? khrushchev biograph tompson describ the mercuri leader he could be charm or vulgar, ebulli or sullen, he wa given to public display of rage (often contrived) and to soar hyperbol in hi rhetoric. but whatev he was, howev he came across, he wa more human than hi predecessor or even than most of hi foreign counterparts, and for much of the world that wa enough to make the ussr seem less mysteri or menacing. unit state and alli edit earli relat and u.s. visit ( – ) edit khrushchev (right) with u.s. vice presid richard nixon, khrushchev with agricultur secretari ezra taft benson (left of khrushchev) and u.s. ambassador to the unit nation henri cabot lodg (far left) dure hi visit on septemb to the agricultur research servic center khrushchev sought to find a last solut to the problem of a divid germani and of the enclav of west berlin deep within east german territory. in novemb , call west berlin a malign tumor , he gave the unit states, unit kingdom and franc six month to conclud a peac treati with both german state and the soviet union. if one wa not signed, khrushchev stated, the soviet union would conclud a peac treati with east germany. thi would leav east germany, which wa not a parti to treati give the western power access to berlin, in control of the rout to the city. thi ultimatum caus dissent among the western allies, who were reluct to go to war over the issue. khrushchev, however, repeatedli extend the deadline. khrushchev sought to elimin mani convent weapons, and defend the soviet union with missiles. he believ that unless thi occurred, the huge soviet militari would continu to eat up resources, make khrushchev s goal of improv soviet life difficult to achieve. in , khrushchev abandon stalin s plan for a larg navy, believ that the new ship would be too vulner to either convent or nuclear attack. in januari , khrushchev took advantag of improv relat with the u.s. to order a reduct of one third in the size of soviet arm forces, alleg that advanc weapon would make up for the lost troops. while conscript of soviet youth remain in force, exempt from militari servic becam more and more common, especi for students. the soviet had few oper icbms; in spite of this, khrushchev publicli boast of the soviet missil programs, state that soviet weapon were vari and numerous. the first secretari hope that public percept that the soviet were ahead would result in psycholog pressur on the west and polit concessions. the soviet space program, which khrushchev firmli supported, appear to confirm hi claim when the soviet launch sputnik into orbit, a launch mani westerners, includ unit state vice presid richard nixon were convinc wa a hoax. when it becam clear that the launch wa real, and sputnik wa in orbit, western govern conclud that the soviet icbm program wa further along than it actual was. khrushchev ad to thi misapprehens by state in an octob interview that the ussr had all the rockets, of whatev capacity, that it needed. for years, khrushchev would make a point of preced a major foreign trip with a rocket launch, to the discomfitur of hi hosts. the unit state learn of the primit state of the soviet missil program from overflight in the late s, but onli high u.s. offici knew of the deception. in januari , khrushchev told the presidium that soviet icbm made an agreement with the u.s. possibl becaus main street american have begun to shake from fear for the first time in their live . the perceiv missil gap led to a consider defens buildup on the part of the unit states. dure nixon s visit to the soviet union in , khrushchev took part in what later becam known as the kitchen debate. nixon and khrushchev had an impass argument in a model kitchen at the american nation exhibit in moscow, with each defend the econom system of hi country. khrushchev wa invit to visit the unit states, and did so that september, spend thirteen days. khrushchev arriv in washington, dc on hi first visit to the unit state on septemb . the first visit by a soviet premier to the unit state result in an extend media circus. khrushchev brought hi wife, nina petrovna, and adult children with him, though it wa not usual for soviet offici to travel with their families. the peripatet premier visit new york city, lo angeles, san francisco (visit a supermarket), coon rapids, iowa (visit roswel garst s farm), pittsburgh, and washington, conclud with a meet with u.s. presid eisenhow at camp david. dure luncheon at the twentieth centuri fox studio in lo angel khrushchev engag in an improvis yet jovial debat with hi host

mccarthy was also a friend of the kennedy family. bobby kennedy worked for mccarthy s subcommittee, and mccarthy dated kennedy sister patricia. in , the senate voted to censure mccarthy, and kennedy drafted a speech supporting the censure. however, it was not delivered because kennedy was hospitalized at the time. the speech had the potential of putting kennedy in the position of participating procedurally by pairing his vote against that of another senator. although kennedy never indicated how he would have voted, the episode damaged his support among members of the liberal community, including eleanor roosevelt, in the and elections. presidential election main articles democratic party presidential primaries and united states presidential election kennedy campaigns with his wife jacqueline in appleton, wisconsin, march on january , , kennedy announced his candidacy for the democratic presidential nomination. though some questioned kennedy s youth and experience, his charisma and eloquence earned him numerous supporters. his greatest obstacle to winning the nomination may have been his religion. many americans held anti catholic attitudes, but kennedy s vocal support of the separation of church and state helped defuse the situation. his religion also helped him win a devoted following among many catholic voters. kennedy faced several potential challengers for the democratic nomination, including senate majority leader lyndon b. johnson, adlai stevenson ii, and senator hubert humphrey. kennedy traveled extensively to build his support among democratic elites and voters. at the time, party officials controlled most of the delegates, but several states also held primaries, and kennedy sought to win several primaries to boost his chances of winning the nomination. in his first major test, kennedy won the wisconsin primary, effectively ending humphrey s hopes of winning the presidency. nonetheless, kennedy and humphrey faced each other in a competitive west virginia primary in which kennedy could not benefit from a catholic bloc, as he had in wisconsin. kennedy won the west virginia primary, impressing many in the party, but at the start of the democratic national convention, it was unclear as to whether he would win the nomination. kennedy and richard nixon participate in the nation s first televised presidential debate, washington, d.c., when kennedy entered the convention, he had the most delegates, but not enough to ensure that he would win the nomination. stevenson—the and presidential nominee—remained very popular in the party, while johnson also hoped to win the nomination with the support from party leaders. kennedy s candidacy also faced opposition from former president harry s. truman, who was concerned about kennedy s lack of experience. kennedy knew that a second ballot could give the nomination to johnson or someone else, and his well organized campaign was able to earn the support of just enough delegates to win the presidential nomination on the first ballot. kennedy ignored the opposition of his brother, who wanted him to choose labor leader walter reuther, and other liberal supporters when he chose johnson as his vice presidential nominee. he believed that the texas senator could help him win support from the south. the choice infuriated many in labor. afl cio president george meany called johnson the arch foe of labor, while illinois afl cio president reuben soderstrom asserted kennedy had made chumps out of leaders of the american labor movement. in accepting the presidential nomination, kennedy gave his well known new frontier speech, saying, for the problems are not all solved and the battles are not all won—and we stand today on the edge of a new frontier. ... but the new frontier of which i speak is not a set of promises—it is a set of challenges. it sums up not what i intend to offer the american people, but what i intend to ask of them. outgoing president dwight d. eisenhower meets with president elect john f. kennedy on december , at the start of the fall general election campaign, republican nominee and incumbent vice president richard nixon held a six point lead in the polls. major issues included how to get the economy moving again, kennedy s roman catholicism, the cuban revolution, and whether the space and missile programs of the soviet union had surpassed those of the u.s. to address fears that his being catholic would impact his decision making, he famously told the greater houston ministerial association on september , i am not the catholic candidate for president. i am the democratic party candidate for president who also happens to be a catholic. i do not speak for my church on public matters – and the church does not speak for me. kennedy questioned rhetorically whether one quarter of americans were relegated to second class citizenship just because they were catholic, and once stated that n o one asked me my religion serving the navy in the south pacific. between september and october, kennedy squared off against nixon in the first televised presidential debates in u.s. history. during these programs, nixon had an injured leg, five o clock shadow , and was perspiring, making him look tense and uncomfortable. conversely, kennedy wore makeup and appeared relaxed, which helped the large television audience to view him as the winner. on average radio listeners thought that nixon had won or that the debates were a draw. the debates are now considered a milestone in american political history—the point at which the medium of television began to play a dominant role in politics. electoral vote results kennedy s campaign gained momentum after the first debate, and he pulled slightly ahead of nixon in most polls. on election day, kennedy defeated nixon in one of the closest presidential elections of the th century. in the national popular vote, by most accounts, kennedy led nixon by just two tenths of one percent ( . % to . %), while in the electoral college, he won votes to nixon s ( were needed to win). fourteen electors from mississippi and alabama refused to support kennedy because of his support for the civil rights movement; they voted for senator harry f. byrd of virginia, as did an elector from oklahoma. kennedy became the youngest person ( ) ever elected to the presidency, though

the presidential oath of office administered by chief justice earl warren on january , , at the capitol. john f. kennedy was sworn in as the th president at noon on january , . in his inaugural address, he spoke of the need for all americans to be active citizens, famously saying ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country. he asked the nations of the world to join together to fight what he called the common enemies of man tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself. he added all this will not be finished in the first one hundred days. nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days, nor in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. but let us begin. in closing, he expanded on his desire for greater internationalism finally, whether you are citizens of america or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you. the address reflected kennedy s confidence that his administration would chart a historically significant course in both domestic policy and foreign affairs. the contrast between this optimistic vision and the pressures of managing daily political realities at home and abroad would be one of the main tensions running through the early years of his administration. john f. kennedy speaking at rice university in houston on september , . lyndon johnson can be seen behind him. kennedy brought to the white house a contrast in organization compared to the decision making structure of former general eisenhower, and he wasted no time in scrapping eisenhower s methods. kennedy preferred the organizational structure of a wheel with all the spokes leading to the president. he was ready and willing to make the increased number of quick decisions required in such an environment. he selected a mixture of experienced and inexperienced people to serve in his cabinet. we can learn our jobs together , he stated. much to the chagrin of his economic advisors, who wanted him to reduce taxes, kennedy quickly agreed to a balanced budget pledge. this was needed in exchange for votes to expand the membership of the house rules committee in order to give the democrats a majority in setting the legislative agenda. kennedy focused on immediate and specific issues facing the administration, and quickly voiced his impatience with pondering of deeper meanings. deputy national security advisor walt whitman rostow once began a diatribe about the growth of communism, and kennedy abruptly cut him off, asking, what do you want me to do about that today? kennedy approved defense secretary robert mcnamara s controversial decision to award the contract for the f tfx (tactical fighter experimental) fighter bomber to general dynamics (the choice of the civilian defense department) over boeing (the choice of the military). at the request of senator henry jackson, senator john mcclellan held days of mostly closed door hearings before the permanent subcommittee on investigations investigating the tfx contract from february to november . during the summer of , kennedy had a secret taping system set up in the white house, most likely to aid his future memoir. it recorded many conversations with kennedy and his cabinet members, including those in relation to the cuban missile crisis . foreign policy main article foreign policy of the john f. kennedy administration foreign trips of john f. kennedy during his presidency president kennedy s foreign policy was dominated by american confrontations with the soviet union, manifested by proxy contests in the early stage of the cold war. in , he anxiously anticipated a summit with soviet premier nikita khrushchev. he started off on the wrong foot by reacting aggressively to a routine khrushchev speech on cold war confrontation in early . the speech was intended for domestic audiences in the soviet union, but kennedy interpreted it as a personal challenge. his mistake helped raise tensions going into the vienna summit of june . on the way to the summit, kennedy stopped in paris to meet charles de gaulle, who advised him to ignore khrushchev s abrasive style. the french president feared the united states presumed influence in europe. nevertheless, de gaulle was quite impressed with the young president and his family. kennedy picked up on this in his speech in paris, saying that he would be remembered as the man who accompanied jackie kennedy to paris. the kekkonens from finland visited the united states and met john f. kennedy in . from left president urho kekkonen, sylvi kekkonen, jacqueline kennedy onassis and john f. kennedy. on june , , the president met with khrushchev in vienna and left the meetings angry and disappointed that he had allowed the premier to bully him, despite the warnings he had received. khrushchev, for his part, was impressed with the president s intelligence, but thought him weak. kennedy did succeed in conveying the bottom line to khrushchev on the most sensitive issue before them, a proposed treaty between moscow and east berlin. he made it clear that any treaty interfering with u.s access rights in west berlin would be regarded as an act of war. shortly after the president returned home, the u.s.s.r. announced its plan to sign a treaty with east berlin, abrogating any third party occupation rights in either sector of the city. depressed and angry, kennedy assumed that his only option was to prepare the country for nuclear war, which he personally thought had a one in five chance of occurring. kennedy with kwame nkrumah, the first head of an independent ghana, march kennedy with the italian prime minister amintore fanfani, at the white house, in in the weeks immediately following the vienna summit, more than , people fled from east berlin to the western sector, reacting to statements from the ussr. kennedy began intensive meetings on the berlin issue, where dean acheson took the lead in recommending a military buildup alongside nato allies. in a july speech, kennedy announced his decision to add $ . billion (equivalent to $ . billion in ) to the defense budget, along with over , additional troops, stating that an attack on west berlin would be taken as an attack on the u.s. the speech received an % approval rating. a month later, both the soviet union and east berlin began blocking any further passage of east berliners into west berlin and erected barbed wire fences across the city, which were quickly upgraded to the berlin wall. kennedy s initial reaction was to ignore this, as long as free access from west to east berlin continued. this course was altered when west berliners had lost confidence in the defense of their position by the united states. kennedy sent vice president johnson, along with a host of military personnel, in convoy through west germany, including soviet armed checkpoints, to demonstrate the continued commitment of the u.s. to west berlin. kennedy gave a speech at saint anselm college on may , , regarding america s conduct in the emerging cold war. the address detailed how the american foreign policy should be conducted towards african nations, noting a hint of support for modern african nationalism by saying, for we, too, founded a new nation on revolt from colonial rule. cuba and the bay of pigs invasion main article bay of pigs invasion the eisenhower administration had created a plan to overthrow fidel castro s regime in cuba. led by the central intelligence agency (cia), with help from the u.s. military, the plan was for an invasion of cuba by a counter revolutionary insurgency composed of u.s. trained, anti castro cuban exiles led by cia paramilitary officers. the intention was to invade cuba and instigate an uprising among the cuban people, hoping to remove castro from power. kennedy approved the final invasion plan on april , . the president and vice president take a leisurely stroll on the white house grounds the bay of pigs invasion began on april , . fifteen hundred u.s. trained cubans, dubbed brigade , landed on the island. no u.s. air support was provided. cia director allen dulles later stated that they thought the president would authorize any action that was needed for success once the troops were on the ground. by april , , the cuban government had captured or killed the invading exiles, and kennedy was forced to negotiate for the release of the , survivors. twenty months later, cuba released the captured exiles in exchange for $ million worth of food and medicine. the incident made castro feel wary of the u.s. and led him to believe that another invasion would take place. biographer richard reeves said that kennedy focused primarily on the political repercussions of the plan rather than military considerations. when it proved unsuccessful, he was convinced that the plan was a setup to make him look bad. he took responsibility for the failure, saying, we got a big kick in the leg and we deserved it. but maybe we ll learn something from it. in late , the white house formed the special group (augmented), headed by robert kennedy and including edward lansdale, secretary robert mcnamara, and others. the group s objective—to overthrow castro via espionage, sabotage, and other covert tactics—was never pursued. cuban missile crisis main article cuban missile crisis

to this article cuban missile crisis on october , , cia u spy planes took photographs of the soviets construction of intermediate range ballistic missile sites in cuba. the photos were shown to kennedy on october ; a consensus was reached that the missiles were offensive in nature and thus posed an immediate nuclear threat. kennedy faced a dilemma if the u.s. attacked the sites, it might lead to nuclear war with the u.s.s.r., but if the u.s. did nothing, it would be faced with the increased threat from close range nuclear weapons. the u.s. would also appear to the world as less committed to the defense of the hemisphere. on a personal level, kennedy needed to show resolve in reaction to khrushchev, especially after the vienna summit. soviet premier nikita khrushchev and kennedy confer in vienna, more than a third of u.s. national security council (nsc) members favored an unannounced air assault on the missile sites, but for some of them this conjured up an image of pearl harbor in reverse . there was also some concern from the international community (asked in confidence), that the assault plan was an overreaction in light of the fact that eisenhower had placed pgm jupiter missiles in italy and turkey in . it also could not be assured that the assault would be % effective. in concurrence with a majority vote of the nsc, kennedy decided on a naval quarantine. on october , he dispatched a message to khrushchev and announced the decision on tv. the u.s. navy would stop and inspect all soviet ships arriving off cuba, beginning october . the organization of american states gave unanimous support to the removal of the missiles. the president exchanged two sets of letters with khrushchev, to no avail. united nations (un) secretary general u thant requested both parties to reverse their decisions and enter a cooling off period. khrushchev agreed, but kennedy didn t. one soviet flagged ship was stopped and boarded. on october , khrushchev agreed to dismantle the missile sites, subject to un inspections. the u.s. publicly promised never to invade cuba and privately agreed to remove its jupiter missiles from italy and turkey, which were by then obsolete and had been supplanted by submarines equipped with ugm polaris missiles. this crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or after. in the end, the humanity of the two men prevailed. the crisis improved the image of american willpower and the president s credibility. kennedy s approval rating increased from % to % immediately thereafter. latin america and communism main article foreign policy of the john f. kennedy administration § latin america kennedy with chilean president jorge alessandri, on an official visit in december believing that those who make peaceful revolution impossible, will make violent revolution inevitable, kennedy sought to contain the perceived threat of communism in latin america by establishing the alliance for progress, which sent aid to some countries and sought greater human rights standards in the region. he worked closely with puerto rican governor luis muñoz marín for the development of the alliance of progress, and began working towards puerto rico s autonomy. the eisenhower administration, through the cia, had begun formulating plans to assassinate castro in cuba and rafael trujillo in the dominican republic. when president kennedy took office, he privately instructed the cia that any plan must include plausible deniability by the u.s. his public position was in opposition. in june , the dominican republic s leader was assassinated; in the days following, undersecretary of state chester bowles led a cautious reaction by the nation. robert kennedy, who saw an opportunity for the u.s., called bowles a gutless bastard to his face. peace corps executive order establishment of the peace corps john f. kennedy s announcement of the establishment of the peace corps problems playing this

communist threat in southeast asia required priority; eisenhower considered laos to be the cork in the bottle regarding the regional threat. in march , kennedy voiced a change in policy from supporting a free laos to a neutral laos, indicating privately that vietnam, and not laos, should be deemed america s tripwire for communism s spread in the area. in may, he dispatched lyndon johnson to meet with south vietnamese president ngo dinh diem. johnson assured diem more aid to mold a fighting force that could resist the communists. kennedy announced a change of policy from support to partnership with diem to defeat of communism in south vietnam. during his presidency, kennedy continued policies that provided political, economic, and military support to the south vietnamese government. in late , the viet cong began assuming a predominant presence, initially seizing the provincial capital of phuoc vinh. kennedy increased the number of military advisors and special forces in the area, from , in to , by late , but he was reluctant to order a full scale deployment of troops. a year and three months later on march , , his successor, president lyndon johnson, committed the first combat troops to vietnam and greatly escalated u.s. involvement, with forces reaching , that year and , in . in late , president kennedy sent roger hilsman, then director of the state department s bureau of intelligence and research, to assess the situation in vietnam. there, hilsman met sir robert thompson, head of the british advisory mission to south vietnam, and the strategic hamlet program was formed. it was approved by kennedy and south vietnam president ngo dinh diem. it was implemented in early and involved some forced relocation, village internment, and segregation of rural south vietnamese into new communities where the peasantry would be isolated from communist insurgents. it was hoped that these new communities would provide security for the peasants and strengthen the tie between them and the central government. by november , the program waned and officially ended in . in early , kennedy formally authorized escalated involvement when he signed the national security action memorandum – subversive insurgency (war of liberation) . operation ranch hand , a large scale aerial defoliation effort, began on the roadsides of south vietnam. depending on which assessment kennedy accepted (department of defense or state), there had been zero or modest progress in countering the increase in communist aggression in return for an expanded u.s. involvement. kennedy with future australian prime minister harold holt in the oval office in in april , kennedy assessed the situation in vietnam, saying, we don t have a prayer of staying in vietnam. those people hate us. they are going to throw our asses out of there at any point. but i can t give up that territory to the communists and get the american people to re elect me. on august , just as the new u.s. ambassador henry cabot lodge jr. arrived, diem and his brother ngo dinh nhu ordered south vietnam forces, funded and trained by the cia, to quell buddhist demonstrations. the crackdowns heightened expectations of a coup d état to remove diem with (or perhaps by) his brother, nhu. lodge was instructed to try getting diem and nhu to step down and leave the country. diem would not listen to lodge. cable (deptel ) followed, dated august , declaring that washington would no longer tolerate nhu s actions, and lodge was ordered to pressure diem to remove nhu. lodge concluded that the only option was to get the south vietnamese generals to overthrow diem and nhu. at week s end, orders were sent to saigon and throughout washington to destroy all coup cables . at the same time, the first formal anti vietnam war sentiment was expressed by u.s. clergy from the ministers vietnam committee. a white house meeting in september was indicative of the different ongoing appraisals; the president was given updated assessments after personal inspections on the ground by the departments of defense (general victor krulak) and state (joseph mendenhall). krulak said that the military fight against the communists was progressing and being won, while mendenhall stated that the country was civilly being lost to any u.s. influence. kennedy reacted, asking, did you two gentlemen visit the same country? the president was unaware that both men were at such odds that they had not spoken to each other on the return flight. in october , the president appointed defense secretary mcnamara and general maxwell d. taylor to a vietnamese mission in another effort to synchronize the information and formulation of policy. the objective of the mcnamara taylor mission emphasized the importance of getting to the bottom of the differences in reporting from u.s. representatives in vietnam. in meetings with mcnamara, taylor, and lodge, diem again refused to agree to governing measures, helping to dispel mcnamara s previous optimism about diem. taylor and mcnamara were enlightened by vietnam s vice president, nguyen ngoc tho (choice of many to succeed diem), who in detailed terms obliterated taylor s information that the military was succeeding in the countryside. at kennedy s insistence, the mission report contained a recommended schedule for troop withdrawals , by year s end and complete withdrawal in , something the nsc considered to be a strategic fantasy . in late october, intelligence wires again reported that a coup against the diem government was afoot. the source, vietnamese general duong van minh (also known as big minh ), wanted to know the u.s. position. kennedy instructed lodge to offer covert assistance to the coup, excluding assassination. on november , , south vietnamese generals, led by big minh , overthrew the diem government, arresting and then killing diem and nhu. kennedy was shocked by the deaths. news of the coup led to renewed confidence initially—both in america and in south vietnam—that the war might be won. mcgeorge bundy drafted a national security action memo to present to kennedy upon his return from dallas. it reiterated the resolve to fight communism in vietnam, with increasing military and economic aid and expansion of operations into laos and cambodia. before leaving for dallas, kennedy told michael forrestal that after the first of the year ... he wanted an in depth study of every possible option, including how to get out of there ... to review this whole thing from the bottom to the top. when asked what he thought the president meant, forrestal said, it was devil s advocate stuff. kennedy delivers the commencement speech at american university, june , historians disagree on whether vietnam would have escalated if kennedy not been assassinated and had won re election in . fueling the debate were statements made by secretary of defense mcnamara in the film the fog of war that kennedy was strongly considering pulling the united states out of vietnam after the election. the film also contains a tape recording of lyndon johnson stating that kennedy was planning to withdraw, a position in which johnson disagreed. kennedy had signed national security action memorandum (nsam) , dated october , which ordered the withdrawal of , military personnel by year s end, and the bulk of them out by . such an action would have been a policy reversal, but kennedy was moving in a less hawkish direction since his speech on world peace at american university on june , . at the time of kennedy s death, no final policy decision was made to vietnam. in , theodore sorensen wrote, i would like to believe that kennedy would have found a way to withdraw all american instructors and advisors from vietnam . but ... i do not believe he knew in his last weeks what he was going to do. sorensen added that, in his opinion, vietnam was the only foreign policy problem handed off by jfk to his successor in no better, and possibly worse, shape than it was when he inherited it. u.s. involvement in the region escalated until his successor lyndon johnson directly deployed regular u.s. military forces for fighting the vietnam war. after kennedy s assassination, president johnson signed nsam on november , . it reversed kennedy s decision to withdraw , troops, and reaffirmed the policy of assistance to

vulnerability due to soviet aggression to the east as well as the impending retirement of west german chancellor adenauer. at the same time, french president charles de gaulle was trying to build a franco west german counterweight to the american and soviet spheres of influence. to kennedy s eyes, this franco german cooperation seemed directed against nato s influence in europe. on june , president kennedy gave a public speech in west berlin. he reiterated the american commitment to germany and criticized communism, and was met with an ecstatic response from a massive audience. kennedy used the construction of the berlin wall as an example of the failures of communism freedom has many difficulties, and democracy is not perfect. but we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in, to prevent them from leaving us. the speech is known for its famous phrase ich bin ein berliner ( i am a citizen of berlin ). a million people were on the street for the speech. kennedy remarked to ted sorensen afterwards we ll never have another day like this one, as long as we live. see also tear down this wall! israel in , kennedy stated, israel will endure and flourish. it is the child of hope and the home of the brave. it can neither be broken by adversity nor demoralized by success. it carries the shield of democracy and it honors the sword of freedom. subsequently, as president, kennedy initiated the creation of security ties with israel, and he is credited as the founder of the us israeli military alliance (which would be continued under subsequent presidents). kennedy ended the arms embargo that the eisenhower and truman administrations had enforced on israel. describing the protection of israel as a moral and national commitment, he was the first to introduce the concept of a special relationship (as he described it to golda meir) between the us and israel. kennedy with israeli foreign minister golda meir, december , kennedy extended the first informal security guarantees to israel in and, beginning in , was the first us president to allow the sale to israel of advanced us weaponry (the mim hawk) as well as to provide diplomatic support for israeli policies, which were opposed by arab neighbors; those policies included israel s water project on the jordan river. as result of this newly created security alliance, kennedy also encountered tensions with the israeli government over the production of nuclear materials in dimona, which he believed could instigate a nuclear arms race in the middle east. after the existence of a nuclear plant was initially denied by the israeli government, david ben gurion stated in a speech to the israeli knesset on december , , that the purpose of the nuclear plant at beersheba was for research in problems of arid zones and desert flora and fauna. when ben gurion met with kennedy in new york, he claimed that dimona was being developed to provide nuclear power for desalinization and other peaceful purposes for the time being. in a may letter to ben gurion, kennedy wrote that he was skeptical and stated that american support to israel could be in jeopardy if reliable information on the israeli nuclear program was not forthcoming, ben gurion repeated previous reassurances that dimona was being developed for peaceful purposes. the israeli government resisted american pressure to open its nuclear facilities to international atomic energy agency (iaea) inspections. in , the us and israeli governments had agreed to an annual inspection regime. a science attaché at the embassy in tel aviv concluded that parts of the dimona facility had been shut down temporarily to mislead american scientists when they visited. according to seymour hersh, the israelis set up false control rooms to show the americans. israeli lobbyist abe feinberg stated it was part of my job to tip them off that kennedy was insisting on an inspection . hersh contends that the inspections were conducted in such a way that it guaranteed that the whole procedure would be little more than a whitewash, as the president and his senior advisors had to understand the american inspection team would have to schedule its visits well in advance, and with the full acquiescence of israel. marc trachtenberg argued that a lthough he was well aware of what the israelis were doing, kennedy chose to take this as satisfactory evidence of israeli compliance with america s non proliferation policy. the american who led the inspection team stated that the essential goal of the inspections was to find ways to not reach the point of taking action against israel s nuclear weapons program. rodger davies, the director of the state department s office of near eastern affairs, concluded in march that israel was developing nuclear weapons. he reported that israel s target date for achieving nuclear capability was – . on may , , undersecretary of state nicholas katzenbach told president johnson that dimona was producing enough plutonium to produce two bombs a year. the state department argued that if israel wanted arms, it should accept international supervision of its nuclear program. dimona was never placed under iaea safeguards. attempts to write israeli adherence to the nuclear non proliferation treaty (npt) into contracts for the supply of u.s. weapons continued throughout . iraq main article foreign policy of the john f. kennedy administration § iraq mohammad reza pahlavi, shah of iran, kennedy, and u.s. defense secretary robert mcnamara in the white house cabinet room on april , relations between the united states and iraq became strained following the overthrow of the iraqi monarchy on july , , which resulted in the declaration of a republican government led by brigadier abd al karim qasim. on june , , qasim mobilized troops along the border between iraq and kuwait, declaring the latter nation an indivisible part of iraq and causing a short lived kuwait crisis . the united kingdom—which had just granted kuwait independence on june , and whose economy was heavily dependent on kuwaiti oil—responded on july by dispatching , troops to the country to deter an iraqi invasion. at the same time, kennedy dispatched a u.s. navy task force to bahrain, and the uk (at the urging of the kennedy administration) brought the dispute to united nations security council, where the proposed resolution was vetoed by the soviet union. the situation was resolved in october, when the british troops were withdrawn and replaced by a , strong arab league force. in december , qasim s government passed public law , which restricted the british and american owned iraq petroleum company (ipc) s concessionary holding to those areas in which oil was actually being produced, effectively expropriating . % of the ipc concession. u.s. officials were alarmed by the expropriation as well as the recent soviet veto of an egyptian sponsored un resolution requesting the admittance of kuwait as un member state, which they believed were connected. senior national security council adviser robert komer worried that if the ipc ceased production in response, qasim might grab kuwait (thus achieving a stranglehold on middle eastern oil production) or throw himself into russian arms. komer also made note of widespread rumors that a nationalist coup against qasim could be imminent, and had the potential to get iraq back on a more neutral keel. in april , the state department issued new guidelines on iraq that were intended to increase american influence there. meanwhile, kennedy instructed the cia—under the direction of archibald bulloch roosevelt jr.—to begin making preparations for a military coup against qasim. the anti imperialist and anti communist iraqi ba ath party overthrew and executed qasim in a violent coup on february , . while there have been persistent rumors that the cia orchestrated the coup, declassified documents and the testimony of former cia officers indicate that there was no direct american involvement, although the cia was actively seeking a suitable replacement for qasim within the iraqi military and had been informed of an earlier ba athist coup plot. the kennedy administration was pleased with the outcome and ultimately approved a $ million arms deal for iraq. ireland john f. kennedy visiting the john barry memorial at crescent quay in wexford, ireland president kennedy in motorcade in patrick street, cork, in ireland on june , during his four day visit to his ancestral home of ireland in june , kennedy accepted a grant of armorial bearings from the chief herald of ireland and received honorary degrees from the national university of ireland and trinity college, dublin. he visited the cottage at dunganstown, near new ross, county wexford, where his ancestors had lived before emigrating to america. kennedy also was the first foreign leader to address the houses of the oireachtas (the irish parliament). on december , , the irish department of justice released declassified police documents indicating that security was heightened as kennedy was the subject of three death threats during this visit. nuclear test ban treaty main article partial nuclear test ban treaty troubled by the long term dangers of radioactive contamination and nuclear weapons proliferation, kennedy and khrushchev agreed to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty, originally conceived in adlai stevenson s presidential campaign. in their vienna summit meeting in june , khrushchev and kennedy both reached an informal understanding against nuclear testing, but the soviet union began testing nuclear weapons that september. in response, the united states conducted tests five days later. shortly afterwards, new u.s. satellites began delivering images which made it clear that the soviets were substantially behind the u.s. in the arms race. nevertheless, the greater nuclear strength of the u.s. was of little value as long as the u.s.s.r. perceived itself to be at parity. in july , kennedy sent w. averell harriman to moscow to negotiate a treaty with the soviets. the introductory sessions included khrushchev, who later delegated soviet representation to andrei gromyko. it quickly became clear that a comprehensive test ban would not be implemented, due largely to the reluctance of the soviets to allow inspections that would verify compliance. ultimately, the united states, the united kingdom, and the soviet union were the initial signatories to a limited treaty, which prohibited atomic testing on the ground, in the atmosphere, or underwater, but not underground. the u.s. senate ratified this and kennedy signed it into law in october . france was quick to declare that it was free to continue developing and testing its nuclear defenses. domestic policy president kennedy in fort worth, texas, on friday morning, november , kennedy called his domestic program the new frontier . it ambitiously promised federal funding for education, medical care for the elderly, economic aid to rural regions, and government intervention to halt the recession. he also promised an end to racial discrimination, although his agenda, which included the endorsement of the voter education project (vep) in , produced little progress in areas such as mississippi, where the vep concluded that discrimination was so entrenched . in his state of the union address, he proposed substantial tax reform and a reduction in income tax rates from the current range of – % to a range of – % as well as a reduction in the corporate tax rates from to %. kennedy added that the top rate should be set at % if certain deductions were not eliminated for high income earners. congress did not act until , a year after his death, when the top individual rate was lowered to %, and the top corporate rate was set at %. to the economic club of new york, he spoke in of ... the paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high and revenues too low; and the soundest way to raise revenue in the long term is to lower rates now. congress passed few of kennedy s major programs during his lifetime, but did vote them through in and under his successor johnson. economy kennedy ended a period of tight fiscal policies, loosening monetary policy to keep interest rates down and to encourage growth of the economy. he presided over the first government budget to top the $ billion mark, in , and his first budget in resulted in the nation s first non war, non recession deficit. the economy, which had been through two recessions in three years and was in one when kennedy took office, accelerated notably throughout his administration. despite low inflation and interest rates, the gdp had grown by an average of only . % per annum during the eisenhower administration (scarcely more than population growth at the time), and it had declined by % during eisenhower s last twelve months in office. the economy turned around and prospered during kennedy s years as president. the gdp expanded by an average of . % from early to late , while inflation remained steady at around % and unemployment eased. industrial production rose by % and motor vehicle sales increased by %. this rate of growth in gdp and industry continued until , and has yet to be repeated for such a sustained period of time. attorney general robert kennedy took the position that steel executives had illegally colluded to fix prices. he stated, we re going for broke. ... their expense accounts, where they ve been and what they ve been doing. ... the fbi is to interview them all. ... we can t lose this. the administration s actions influenced u.s. steel to rescind the price increase. the wall street journal wrote that the administration had acted by naked power, by threats, and by agents of the state security police. yale law professor charles reich opined in the new republic that the administration had violated civil liberties by calling a grand jury to indict u.s. steel for collusion so quickly. an editorial in the new york times praised kennedy s actions and said that the steel industry s price increase imperil ed the economic welfare of the country by inviting a tidal wave of inflation. nevertheless, the administration s bureau of budget reported the price increase would have caused a net gain for the gdp as well as a net budget surplus. the stock market, which had steadily declined since kennedy s election in , dropped % shortly after the administration s action on the steel industry took place. federal and military death penalty during his administration, kennedy oversaw the last federal execution prior to furman v. georgia, a case that led to a moratorium on federal executions. victor feguer was sentenced to death by an iowa federal court and was executed on march , . kennedy commuted a death sentence imposed by a military court on seaman jimmie henderson on february , , changing the penalty to life in prison. on march , , kennedy signed into law hr (pl ), which abolished the mandatory death penalty for first degree murder suspects in the district of columbia, the only remaining jurisdiction in the united states with such a penalty. the death penalty has not been applied in the district of columbia since , and has now been abolished. civil rights movement thurgood marshall, appointed to the federal bench by kennedy in may the turbulent end of state sanctioned racial discrimination was one of the most pressing domestic issues of the s. jim crow segregation was the established law in the deep south. the u.s. supreme court had ruled in in brown v. board of education that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. many schools, especially those in southern states, did not obey the supreme court s decision. the court also prohibited segregation at other public facilities (such as buses, restaurants, theaters, courtrooms, bathrooms, and beaches) but it continued nonetheless. kennedy verbally supported racial integration and civil rights; during his presidential campaign, he telephoned coretta scott king, wife of the reverend martin luther king jr., who had been jailed while trying to integrate a department store lunch counter. robert kennedy called georgia governor ernest vandiver and obtained king s release from prison, which drew additional black support to his brother s candidacy. upon taking office in , kennedy postponed promised civil rights legislation he made while campaigning in , recognizing that conservative southern democrats controlled congressional legislation. historian carl m. brauer concluded that passing any civil rights legislation in would have been futile. during his first year in office, kennedy appointed many blacks to office including his may appointment of civil rights attorney thurgood marshall to the federal bench. in his first state of the union address in january , president kennedy said, the denial of constitutional rights to some of our fellow americans on account of race – at the ballot box and elsewhere – disturbs the national conscience, and subjects us to the charge of world opinion that our democracy is not equal to the high promise of our heritage. kennedy believed the grassroots movement for civil rights would anger many southern whites and make it more difficult to pass civil rights laws in congress, including anti poverty legislation, and he distanced himself from it. kennedy was concerned with other issues in the early part of his administration, such as the cold war, bay of pigs fiasco, and the situation in southeast asia. as articulated by his brother robert, the administration s early priority was to keep the president out of this civil rights mess. civil rights movement participants, mainly those on the front line in the south, viewed kennedy as lukewarm, especially concerning the freedom riders, who organized an integrated public transportation effort in the south, and who were repeatedly met with white mob violence, including by law enforcement officers, both federal and state. kennedy assigned federal marshals to protect the freedom riders rather than using federal troops or uncooperative fbi agents. robert kennedy, speaking for the president, urged the freedom riders to get off the buses and leave the matter to peaceful settlement in the courts. kennedy feared sending federal troops would stir up hated memories of reconstruction after the civil war among conservative southern whites. on march , , kennedy signed executive order , which required government contractors to take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin. it established the president s committee on equal employment opportunity. displeased with kennedy s pace addressing the issue of segregation, martin luther king jr. and his associates produced a document in calling on the president to follow in the footsteps of abraham lincoln and use an executive order to deliver a blow for civil rights as a kind of second emancipation proclamation. kennedy did not execute the order. in september , james meredith enrolled at the university of mississippi but was prevented from entering. in response to that, robert kennedy, now u.s. attorney general, sent federal marshals, while president kennedy reluctantly sent , troops after the situation on campus turned out violent. the ole miss riot of left two people dead and a dozen others injured, but meredith did finally enroll for class. kennedy regretted not sending in troops earlier and he began doubting as to whether the evils of reconstruction of the s and s he had been taught or believed in were true. the instigating subculture at the old miss riot, and at many other racially ignited events, was the ku klux klan. on november , , kennedy signed executive order , which prohibited racial discrimination in federally supported housing or related facilities . both the president and the attorney general were concerned about king s ties to suspected communists jack o dell and stanley levison. after the president and his civil rights expert harris wofford pressed king to ask both men to resign from the sclc, king agreed to ask only o dell to resign from the organization and allowed levison, whom he regarded as a trusted advisor, to remain. in early , kennedy related to martin luther king jr. his thoughts on the prospects for civil rights legislation if we get into a long fight over this in congress, it will bottleneck everything else, and we will still get no bill. civil rights clashes were on the rise that year. brother robert and ted sorenson pressed kennedy to take more initiative on the legislative front. kennedy s report to the american people on civil rights, june , on june , , president kennedy intervened when alabama governor george wallace blocked the doorway to the university of alabama to stop two african american students, vivian malone and james hood, from attending. wallace moved aside only after being confronted by deputy attorney general nicholas katzenbach and the alabama u.s. national guard, which had just been federalized by order of the president. that evening kennedy gave his famous report to the american people on civil rights on national television and radio, launching his initiative for civil rights legislation—to provide equal access to public schools and other facilities, and greater protection of voting rights. his proposals became part of the civil rights act of . the day ended with the murder of a naacp leader, medgar evers, in front of his home in mississippi. as the president had predicted, the day after his tv speech, and in reaction to it, house majority leader carl albert called to advise him that his two year signature effort in congress to combat poverty in appalachia (area redevelopment administration) had been defeated, primarily by the votes of southern democrats and republicans. when arthur m. schlesinger jr. complimented kennedy on his remarks, kennedy bitterly replied, yes, and look at what happened to area development the very next day in the house. he then added, but of course, i had to give that speech, and i m glad that i did. on june , the new york times published an editorial which argued that while the president had initially moved too slowly and with little evidence of deep moral commitment in regards to civil rights he now demonstrate d a genuine sense of urgency about eradicating racial discrimination from our national life. earlier, kennedy had signed the executive order creating the presidential commission on the status of women on december , . former first lady eleanor roosevelt led the commission. the commission statistics revealed that women were also experiencing discrimination; its final report, documenting legal and cultural barriers, was issued in october . further, on june , , kennedy signed the equal pay act of , which amended the fair labor standards act and abolished wage disparity based on sex. kennedy meets with leaders of the march on washington in the oval office, august , over a hundred thousand, predominantly african americans gathered in washington for the civil rights march on washington for jobs and freedom on august , . kennedy feared the march would have a negative effect on the prospects for the civil rights bills in congress, and declined an invitation to speak. he turned over some of the details of the government s involvement to the dept. of justice, which channelled hundreds of thousands of dollars to the six sponsors of the march, including the n.a.a.c.p. and martin luther king s southern christian leadership conference (sclc). to ensure a peaceful demonstration, the organizers and the president personally edited speeches which were inflammatory and agreed the march would be held on a wednesday and would be over at pm. thousands of troops were placed on standby. kennedy watched king s speech on tv and was very impressed. the march was considered a triumph of managed protest , and not one arrest relating to the demonstration occurred. afterwards, the march leaders accepted an invitation to the white house to meet with kennedy and photos were taken. kennedy felt that the march was a victory for him as well and bolstered the chances for his civil rights bill. nevertheless, the struggle was far from over. three weeks later, a bomb exploded on sunday, september , at the th street baptist church in birmingham; by the end of the day, four african american children had died in the explosion, and two other children were shot to death in the aftermath. due to this resurgent violence, the civil rights legislation underwent some drastic amendments that critically endangered any prospects for passage of the bill, to the outrage of the president. kennedy called the congressional leaders to the white house and by the following day the original bill, without the additions, had enough votes to get it out of the house committee. gaining republican support, senator everett dirksen promised the legislation would be brought to a vote preventing a senate filibuster. the legislation was enacted by kennedy s successor president lyndon b. johnson, prompted by kennedy s memory, after his assassination in november, enforcing voting rights, public accommodations, employment, education, and the administration of justice. civil liberties in february , fbi director j. edgar hoover, who was suspicious of civil rights leader martin luther king jr. and viewed him as an upstart troublemaker, presented the kennedy administration with allegations that some of king s close confidants and advisers were communists. concerned by these allegations, the fbi deployed agents to monitor king in the following months. robert kennedy and the president also both warned king to discontinue the suspect associations. after the associations continued, robert kennedy issued a written directive authorizing the fbi to wiretap king and other leaders of the southern christian leadership conference, king s civil rights organization, in october . although kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of king s phones on a trial basis, for a month or so , hoover extended the clearance so his men were unshackled to look for evidence in any areas of king s life they deemed worthy. the wiretapping continued through june and was revealed in . immigration during the campaign kennedy proposed an overhaul of american immigration and naturalization laws to ban discrimination based on national origin. he saw this proposal as an extension of his planned civil rights agenda as president. these reforms later became law through the immigration and nationality act of , which dramatically shifted the source of immigration from northern and western european countries towards immigration from latin america and asia. the policy change also shifted the emphasis in the selection of immigrants in favor of family reunification. the late president s brother, senator edward kennedy helped steer the legislation through the senate. native american relations further information kinzua dam § native americans, and seneca nation § kinzua dam construction of the kinzua dam flooded , acres ( , ha) of seneca nation land that they had occupied under the treaty of , and forced seneca to relocate to salamanca, new york. kennedy was asked by the american civil liberties union to intervene and to halt the project, but he declined, citing a critical need for flood control. he expressed concern about the plight of the seneca, and directed government agencies to assist in obtaining more land, damages, and assistance to help mitigate their displacement. space policy further information space race and space policy of the united states jfk inspects mercury capsule, february the apollo program was conceived early in , during the eisenhower administration, as a follow up to project mercury, to be used as a shuttle to an earth orbital space station, flights around the moon, or landing on it. while nasa went ahead with planning for apollo, funding for the program was far from certain, given eisenhower s ambivalent attitude to manned spaceflight. as senator, kennedy had been opposed to the space program and wanted to terminate it. in constructing his presidential administration, kennedy elected to retain eisenhower s last science advisor jerome wiesner as head of the president s science advisory committee. wiesner was strongly opposed to manned space exploration, having issued a report highly critical of project mercury. kennedy was turned down by seventeen candidates for nasa administrator before the post was accepted by james e. webb, an experienced washington insider who served president truman as budget director and undersecretary of state. webb proved to be adept at obtaining the support of congress, the president, and the american people. kennedy also persuaded congress to amend the national aeronautics and space act to allow him to delegate his chairmanship of the national aeronautics and space council to the vice president, both because of the knowledge of the space program johnson gained in the senate working for the creation of nasa, and to help keep the politically savvy johnson occupied. in kennedy s january state of the union address, he had suggested international cooperation in space. khrushchev declined, as the soviets did not wish to reveal the status of their rocketry and space capabilities. early in his presidency, kennedy was poised to dismantle the manned space program, but postponed any decision out of deference to johnson, who had been a strong supporter of the space program in the senate. kennedy s advisors speculated that a moon flight would be prohibitively expensive, and he was considering plans to dismantle the apollo program due to its cost. kennedy proposing a program to congress that will land men on the moon, may . johnson and sam rayburn are seated behind him. however, this quickly changed on april , , when soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin became the first person to fly in space, reinforcing american fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the soviet union. kennedy now became eager for the u.s. to take the lead in the space race, for reasons of national security and prestige. on april , he sent a memo to johnson, asking him to look into the status of america s space program, and into programs that could offer nasa the opportunity to catch up. after consulting with wernher von braun, johnson responded approximately one week later, concluding that we are neither making maximum effort nor achieving results necessary if this country is to reach a position of leadership. his memo concluded that a manned moon landing was far enough in the future that it was likely the united states would achieve it first. kennedy s advisor ted sorensen advised him to support the moon landing, and on may , kennedy announced the goal in a speech titled special message to the congress on urgent national needs ... i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth. no single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish. full text play media kennedy speaks at rice university, september , (duration ) after congress authorized the funding, webb began reorganizing nasa, increasing its staffing level, and building two new centers a launch operations center for the large moon rocket northwest of cape canaveral air force station, and a manned spacecraft center on land donated through rice university in houston, texas. kennedy took the latter occasion as an opportunity to deliver another speech at rice to promote the space effort on september , , in which he said no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space. ... we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard. full text on november , , in a cabinet meeting with nasa administrator webb and other officials, kennedy explained that the moon shot was important for reasons of international prestige, and that the expense was justified. johnson assured him that lessons learned from the space program had military value as well. costs for the apollo program were expected to reach $ billion (equivalent to $ . billion in ). in a september speech before the united nations, kennedy urged cooperation between the soviets and americans in space, specifically recommending that apollo be switched to a joint expedition to the moon . khrushchev again declined, and the soviets did not commit to a manned moon mission until . on july , , almost six years after kennedy s death, apollo landed the first manned spacecraft on the moon. administration, cabinet, and judicial appointments the kennedy cabinetofficenametermpresidentjohn f. kennedy – vice

connallys in the presidential limousine moments before the assassination in dallas president kennedy was assassinated in dallas, texas, at pm central standard time on friday, november , . he was in texas on a political trip to smooth over frictions in the democratic party between liberals ralph yarborough and don yarborough (no relation) and conservative john connally. traveling in a presidential motorcade through downtown dallas, he was shot once in the back, the bullet exiting via his throat, and once in the head. kennedy was taken to parkland hospital for emergency medical treatment, where he was pronounced dead minutes later. he was years old and had been in office for , days. lee harvey oswald, an order filler at the texas school book depository from which the shots were suspected to have been fired, was arrested for the murder of police officer j.d. tippit, and was subsequently charged with kennedy s assassination. he denied shooting anyone, claiming he was a patsy, and was shot by jack ruby on november , before he could be prosecuted. ruby was arrested and convicted for the murder of oswald. ruby successfully appealed his conviction and death sentence but became ill and died of cancer on january , , while the date for his new trial was being set. president johnson quickly issued an executive order to create the warren commission—chaired by chief justice earl warren—to investigate the assassination. the commission concluded that oswald acted alone in killing kennedy and that oswald was not part of any conspiracy. the results of this investigation are disputed by many. the assassination proved to be a pivotal moment in u.s. history because of its impact on the nation, and the ensuing political repercussions. a fox news poll found that % of americans thought there had been a conspiracy to kill president kennedy, while % thought that there had been a cover up. a gallup poll in november showed % believed in a conspiracy, and only % thought that oswald did it alone. in , the u.s. house select committee on assassinations concluded that it believed that kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy. the committee was unable to identify the other gunmen or the extent of the conspiracy. in , historian carl m. brauer concluded that the public s fascination with the assassination may indicate a psychological denial of kennedy s death, a mass wish ... to undo it. funeral main article state funeral of john f. kennedy president kennedy s family leaving his funeral at the u.s. capitol building a requiem mass was celebrated for kennedy at the cathedral of st. matthew the apostle on november , . afterwards, kennedy was interred in a small plot, by ft., in arlington national cemetery. over a period of three years ( – ), an estimated million people visited his grave. on march , , kennedy s remains were disinterred and moved only a few feet away to a permanent burial plot and memorial. it was from this memorial that the graves of both robert and ted kennedy were modeled. the honor guard at kennedy s graveside was the th cadet class of the irish army. kennedy was greatly impressed by the irish cadets on his last official visit to ireland, so much so that jackie kennedy requested the irish army to be the honor guard at her husband s funeral. kennedy s wife jacqueline and their two deceased minor children were later interred in the same plot. jfk s brother robert was buried nearby in june . in august , ted was also buried near his two brothers. john f. kennedy s grave is lit with an eternal

family is one of the most established political families in the united states, having produced a president, three senators, three ambassadors, and multiple other representatives and politicians, both at the federal and state level. while a congressman, kennedy embarked on a seven week trip to india, japan, vietnam, and israel in , at which point he became close with his then year old brother bobby, as well as his year old sister pat. because they were several years apart in age, the brothers had previously seen little of each other. this , mile ( , km) trip was the first extended time they had spent together and resulted in their becoming best friends. bobby would eventually play a major role in his brother s career, serving as his brother s attorney general and presidential advisor. bobby would later run for president in before his assassination, while another kennedy brother, ted, ran for president in . kennedy came in third (behind martin luther king jr. and mother

plane he was piloting crashed en route to martha s vineyard. in , months before jfk s assassination, jackie gave birth to a son, patrick. however, he passed away after days due to complications from birth. popular image the kennedy brothers attorney general robert f. kennedy, senator ted kennedy, and president john f. kennedy in kennedy and his wife were younger in comparison to the presidents and first ladies who preceded them, and both were popular in the media culture in ways more common to pop singers and movie stars than politicians, influencing fashion trends and becoming the subjects of numerous photo spreads in popular magazines. although eisenhower had allowed presidential press conferences to be filmed for television, kennedy was the first president to ask for them to be broadcast live and made good use of the medium. in the radio television news directors association presented kennedy with its highest honor, the paul white award, in recognition of his open relationship with the media. mrs. kennedy brought new art and furniture to the white house, and directed its restoration. they invited a range of artists, writers and intellectuals to rounds of white house dinners, raising the profile of the arts in america. on the white house lawn, the kennedys established a swimming pool and tree house, while caroline attended a preschool along with other children inside the home. the president was closely tied to popular culture, emphasized by songs such as twisting at the white house . vaughn meader s first family comedy album, which parodied the president, the first lady, their family, and the administration, sold about four million copies. on may , , marilyn monroe sang happy birthday, mr. president at a large party in madison square garden, celebrating kennedy s upcoming forty fifth birthday. camelot era the term camelot came to be used retrospectively as iconic of the kennedy administration, and the charisma of kennedy and his family. the term was first publicly used by his wife in a post assassination life magazine interview with theodore h. white, in which she revealed his affection for the contemporary broadway musical of the same name, particularly the closing lines of the title song don t let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief, shining moment that was known as camelot. there ll be great presidents again ... but there will never be another camelot.— jacqueline kennedy health in robert dallek wrote an extensive history of kennedy s health. dallek was able to consult a collection of kennedy associated papers from the years – , including x rays and prescription records from the files of white house physician dr. janet travell. according to travell s records, during his presidential years kennedy suffered from high fevers; stomach, colon, and prostate issues; abscesses; high cholesterol; and adrenal problems. travell kept a medicine administration record, cataloguing kennedy s medications injected and ingested corticosteroids for his adrenal insufficiency; procaine shots and ultrasound treatments and hot packs for his back; lomotil, metamucil, paregoric, phenobarbital, testosterone, and trasentine to control his diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and weight loss; penicillin and other antibiotics for his urinary tract infections and an abscess; and tuinal to help him sleep. years after kennedy s death, it was revealed that in september , while kennedy was and in his first term in congress, he was diagnosed by sir daniel davis at the london clinic with addison s disease, a rare endocrine disorder. in dr. travell revealed that kennedy also had hypothyroidism. the presence of two endocrine diseases raises the possibility that kennedy had autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type (aps ). kennedy also suffered from chronic and severe back pain, for which he had surgery and was written up in the american medical association s archives of surgery. kennedy s condition may have had diplomatic repercussions, as he appears to have been taking a combination of drugs to treat severe back pain during the vienna summit with soviet premier nikita khrushchev. the combination included hormones, animal organ cells, steroids, vitamins, enzymes, and amphetamines, and possible potential side effects included hyperactivity, hypertension, impaired judgment, nervousness, and mood swings. kennedy at one time was regularly seen by no fewer than three doctors, one of whom, max jacobson, was unknown to the other two, as his mode of treatment was controversial and used for the most severe bouts of back pain. into late , disagreements existed among kennedy s doctors concerning his proper balance of medication and exercise. the president preferred the former, because he was short on time and desired immediate relief. during that time, the president s physician, george burkley, did set up some gym equipment in the white house basement, where kennedy did stretching exercises for his back three times a week. details of these and other medical problems were not publicly disclosed during kennedy s lifetime. the president s primary white house physician, george burkley, realized that treatments by jacobson and travell, including the excessive use of steroids and amphetamines, were medically inappropriate, and took effective action to remove the president from their care. it was later observed that president kennedy s leadership (e.g. the cuban missile crisis and other events during ) improved greatly once the treatments of jacobson had been discontinued and been replaced by a medically appropriate regimen under burkley. dr. ghaemi, who studied kennedy s medical records, concluded there was a correlation; it is not causation; but it may not be coincidence either . personal tragedies main article kennedy curse the newlyweds surrounded by jack s siblings on their wedding day in newport, rhode island in kennedy and

friendships attorney general robert f. kennedy, marilyn monroe, president kennedy (back to camera) in kennedy was single in the s when he had affairs with danish journalist inga arvad and actress gene tierney. before and after he assumed the presidency, kennedy reportedly had extramarital affairs with a number of women, including marilyn monroe, gunilla von post, judith campbell, mary pinchot meyer, marlene dietrich, mimi alford, and his wife s press secretary, pamela turnure. the extent of kennedy s relationship with monroe is not fully known, although it has been reported that they spent

director, received reports about kennedy s indiscretions. kennedy inspired affection and loyalty from the members of his team and his supporters. according to reeves, this included the logistics of kennedy s liaisons ... which required secrecy and devotion rare in the annals of the energetic service demanded by successful politicians. kennedy believed that his friendly relationship with members

kennedy. it was president kennedy who was responsible for the rebuilding of the special forces and giving us back our green beret, said forrest lindley, a writer for the us military newspaper stars and stripes who served with special forces in vietnam. a this bond was shown at kennedy s funeral. at the commemoration of the th anniversary of kennedy s death, general michael d. healy, the last commander of special forces in vietnam, spoke at arlington cemetery. later, a wreath in the form of the green beret would be placed on the grave, continuing a tradition that began the day of his funeral when a sergeant in charge of a detail of special forces men guarding the grave placed his beret on the coffin. kennedy was the first of six presidents to have served in the u.s. navy, and one of the enduring legacies of his administration was the creation in of another special forces command, the navy seals, which kennedy enthusiastically supported. the dedication of a new forever stamp to honor what would be president john f. kennedy s th birthday kennedy s civil rights proposals led to the civil rights act of . president lyndon b. johnson, kennedy s successor, took up the mantle and pushed the landmark civil rights act through a bitterly divided congress by invoking the slain president s memory. president johnson then signed the act into law on july , . this civil rights law ended what was known as the solid south and certain provisions were modeled after the civil rights act of , signed into law by president ulysses s. grant. kennedy s continuation of presidents harry s. truman and dwight d. eisenhower s policies of giving economic and military aid to south vietnam left the door open for president johnson s escalation of the conflict. at the time of kennedy s death, no final policy decision had been made as to vietnam, leading historians, cabinet members, and writers to continue to disagree on whether the vietnam conflict would have escalated to the point it did had he survived. his agreement to the nsam action of withdrawing , troops by the end of , and his earlier speech at american university, suggest that he was ready to end the vietnam war. the vietnam war contributed greatly to a decade of national difficulties, amid violent disappointment on the political landscape. kennedy on a u.s. postage stamp, issue of many of kennedy s speeches (especially his inaugural address) are considered iconic; and despite his relatively short term in office, and the lack of major legislative changes coming to fruition during his term, americans regularly vote him as one of the best presidents, in the same league as abraham lincoln, george washington, and franklin d. roosevelt. some excerpts of kennedy s inaugural address are engraved on a plaque at his grave at arlington. in , the times published an audio recreation of the watchmen on the walls of world freedom speech he was scheduled to deliver at the dallas trade mart on november , . he was posthumously awarded the pacem in terris award (latin peace on earth). it was named after a encyclical letter by pope john xxiii that calls upon all people of goodwill to secure peace among all nations. kennedy is the only president to have predeceased both his mother and father. he is also the only president to have predeceased a grandparent. his maternal grandmother, mary josephine josie hannon, died in august , nine months after his assassination. throughout the english speaking world, the given name kennedy has sometimes been used in honor of president kennedy, as well his brother robert. effect of assassination television became the primary source by which people were kept informed of events surrounding john f. kennedy s assassination. in fact, television started to come of age before the assassination. on september , , kennedy helped inaugurate network television s first half hour nightly evening newscast according to an interview with cbs evening news anchor walter cronkite. john f. kennedy presidential library and museum located in boston, massachusetts newspapers were kept as souvenirs rather than sources of updated information. citation needed in this sense his assassination was the first major tv news event of its kind. tv coverage united the nation, interpreting what went on, and creating memories of this space in time. citation needed all three major u.s. television networks suspended their regular schedules and switched to all news coverage from november through november , , being on the air for hours, making it the longest uninterrupted news event on american tv until . the assassination had an effect on many people, not only in the u.s. but around the world. many vividly remember where they were when they first learned the news that kennedy was assassinated, as with the japanese attack on pearl harbor on december , , before it and the september attacks after it. un ambassador adlai stevenson said of the assassination all of us. ... . will bear the grief of his death until the day of ours. many people have also spoken of the shocking news, compounded by the pall of uncertainty about the identity of the assassin(s), the possible instigators, and the causes of the killing, as an end to innocence, and in retrospect it has been coalesced with other changes of the tumultuous decade of the s, especially the vietnam war. ultimately, the death of president kennedy, and the ensuing confusion surrounding the facts of his assassination, are of political and historical importance insofar as they marked a turning point and decline in the faith of the american people in the political establishment—a point made by commentators from gore vidal to arthur m. schlesinger jr. and implied by oliver stone in several of his films, such as his landmark jfk. citation needed memorials and eponyms main article memorials to john f. kennedy john f. kennedy eternal flame memorial john f. kennedy international airport, american
